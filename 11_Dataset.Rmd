# Phylogenetic dataset {#dataset}

Analysis was performed on a new matrix of `r length(names(my_data)) - 1L` early brachiozoan taxa, including hyoliths, tommotiids and mickwitziids, which were coded for `r sum(attr(my_data, 'weight'))` morphological characters (`r sum(neomorphic)` neomorphic, `r sum(!neomorphic)` transformational).

_Namacalathus_ was incorporated as a `r length(names(my_data))`^th^ taxon, but preliminary results did not uphold the homology of its potentially brachiozoan-like features.  As such, we excluded it from our analysis due to its morphological distance from ingroup taxa, a likely source of long branch error.  _Dailyatia_ was instead selected as an outgroup as camenellans have been interpreted as the earliest diverging members of the Brachiozoa [@Skovsted2015Theearly;@Zhao2017].

Characters are coded following the recommendations of @Brazeau2018:

- We have employed reductive coding, using a distinct state to mark character inapplicability. Character specifications follow the model of @Sereno2007.

- We have distinguished between neomorphic and transformational characters [sensu @Sereno2007] by reserving the token `0` to refer to the absence of a neomorphic character.  The states of transformational characters are represented by the tokens `1`, `2`, `3`, ...

- We code the absence of neomorphic ontologically dependent characters [sensu @Vogt2017] as absence, rather than inapplicability.


The complete dataset can be viewed and downloaded at Morphobank ([project 2800](https://morphobank.org/permalink/?P2800)), where each character is defined
and its coding for each taxon discussed.
