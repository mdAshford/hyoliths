It opens with a detailed discussion of analyses of the morphological dataset constructed to accompany Sun et al. (2018), and their results. The results presented in the main paper employ the algorithm described by Brazeau, Guillerme, &amp; Smith (2018) for correct handling of inapplicable data in a parsimony setting. This document depicts how each character is most parsimoniously reconstructed on an optimal tree. For completeness, we also document the results of standard Fitch parsimony analysis, and the results of Bayesian analysis, neither of which treat inapplicable data in a logically consistent fashion.

["dataset.html", "1 Phylogenetic dataset", " 1 Phylogenetic dataset Analysis was performed on a new matrix of 37 early brachiozoan taxa, including hyoliths, tommotiids and mickwitziids, which were coded for 107 morphological characters (62 neomorphic, 45 transformational). Namacalathus was incorporated as a 38th taxon, but preliminary results did not uphold the homology of its potentially brachiozoan-like features. As such, we excluded it from our analysis due to its morphological distance from ingroup taxa, a likely source of long branch error. Dailyatia was instead selected as an outgroup as camenellans have been interpreted as the earliest diverging members of the Brachiozoa (Skovsted, Betts, Topper, &amp; Brock, 2015; Zhao et al., 2017). Characters are coded following the recommendations of Brazeau et al. (2018): We have employed reductive coding, using a distinct state to mark character inapplicability. Character specifications follow the structural syntax of Sereno (2007) in order to highlight ontological dependence between characters and emphasize the structure of the dataset. We have distinguished between neomorphic and transformational characters (sensu Sereno, 2007) by reserving the token 0 to refer to the absence of a neomorphic (i.e. presence/absence) character. The states of transformational characters (i.e. characters that describe a property of a feature) are represented by the tokens 1, 2, 3, … We code the absence of neomorphic ontologically dependent characters (sensu Vogt, 2017) as absence, rather than inapplicability. The complete dataset comprises 3959 character codings, of which 451 are inapplicable and 2319 were neither ambiguous nor inapplicable. The amount and quality of data that is coded is more instructive than a measure of how many cells are ambiguous (Wiens, 1998, 2003). Of the 107 characters, the number that were coded with an applicable token for each taxon is: Acanthotretella spinosa 59   Haplophrentis carinatus 65   Orthis 62   Alisina 75   Heliomedusa orienta 57   Paterimitra 55   Askepasma toddense 65   Kutorgina chengjiangensis 76   Pedunculotheca diania 60   Antigonambonites planus 73   Lingula 93   Pelagodiscus atlanticus 95   Botsfordia 64   Lingulosacculus 49   Phoronis 43   Clupeafumosus socialis 66   Lingulellotreta malongensis 70   Salanygolina 67   Coolinia pecten 69   Longtancunella chengjiangensis 49   Siphonobolus priscus 62   Craniops 57   Micrina 59   Terebratulina 96   Dailyatia 32   Micromitra 69   Ussunia 42   Eccentrotheca 31   Mickwitzia muralensis 63   Tomteluva perturbata 51   Eoobolus 70   Mummpikia nuda 45   Yuganotheca elegans 45   Glyptoria 65   Nisusia sulcata 73   Gasconsia 61   Novocrania 86   The matrix can be viewed interactively and downloaded at Morphobank (project 2800).

["treesearch.html", "2 Parsimony analysis 2.1 Search parameters 2.2 Analysis 2.3 Results", " 2 Parsimony analysis The phylogenetic dataset contains a considerable proportion of inapplicable codings (451/3959 = 11.4% of tokens), which are known to introduce error and bias to phylogenetic reconstruction when the Fitch algorithm is employed (Brazeau et al., 2018; Maddison, 1993). As such, we employed a new tree-scoring algorithm that correctly handles inapplicable data (Brazeau et al., 2018), implemented in the MorphyLib C library (Brazeau, Smith, &amp; Guillerme, 2017). We employed the R package TreeSearch v0.1.2 (Smith, 2018) to conduct phylogenetic tree search with this algorithm. As this is a new method, we also employed the traditional, Fitch algorithm, even though this approach is known to generate erroneous trees. The results of this analysis can be viewed in a later section. 2.1 Search parameters Heuristic searches were conducted using the parsimony ratchet (Nixon, 1999) under equal and implied weights (Goloboff, 1997). The consensus tree presented in the main manuscript represents a strict consensus of all trees that are most parsimonious under one or more of the concavity constants (k) 2, 3, 4.5, 7, 10.5, 16 and 24, an approach that has been shown to produce higher accuracy (i.e. more nodes and quartets resolved correctly) than equal weights at any given level of precision (Smith, 2017). 2.2 Analysis The R commands used to conduct the analysis are reproduced below.

This link will become live on publication of the paper. Referees should follow the pre-publication link to the dataset that has been provided in the main manuscript. Alongside each character’s definition, each character is mapped onto a tree. The tree used for reconstruction can be selected using the links below. Each tip is labelled as it is coded in the matrix, and these states are used to reconstruct the condition of each internal node, using the parsimony method of Brazeau et al. (2018) as implemented in the Inapp R package. We emphasize that different trees will give different reconstructions. The character mappings are not intended to definitively establish how each character evolved, but to help the reader quickly establish how each character has been coded, and to visualize at a glance how well the character fits onto the given tree. We consider this more intuitive than the use of the flawed (Archie, 1989) Consistency Index, but include this value because of its historic significance.

["taxonomic-implications.html", "6 Taxonomic implications", " 6 Taxonomic implications This section briefly places key features of our results in the context of previous phylogenetic hypotheses. Brachiopod crown and stem group Crown- and stem-group terminology has great value in clarifying the early evolution of major lineages (Budd &amp; Jensen, 2000; Carlson &amp; Cohen, 2009). The crown group of a lineage is defined as the last common ancestor of all living members of a group, and all its descendants; the stem group as all taxa more closely related to the crown group than to any other extant taxon. In our analyses, the brachiopod crown group corresponds to the last common ancestor of Terebratulina and Lingula; the brachiopod stem group comprises anything between this node and the branching point of Phoronis. Craniiforms Trimerellids are reconstructed as paraphyletic with respect to Craniiforms. This is consistent with the affinity commonly drawn between these groups (e.g. Williams et al., 2000), and helps to account for the stratigraphically late (Ordovician) appearance of Craniids in the fossil record. (Aragonite is underrepresented in early Palaeozoic strata due to taphonomic bias.) The relationship of Craniiforms with respect to Linguliforms and Rhynchonelliforms remains unclear. Shell characters point to a relationship with the Rhynchonelliforms, which is countered by similarities between the spermatozoa of phoronids and terebratulids, which indicate a craniiform + linguliform clade. It’s worth noting that Bayesian and Fitch analyses place Gasconsia as the basalmost member of the Rhynchonellid lineage, upholding suggestions (Holmer, Popov, &amp; Bassett, 2014) of a chileid rather than trimerellid affinity. This placement presumably represents an artefact resulting from the incorrect handling of inapplicable data. But if true, Gasconsia would be a close analogue for the common ancestor of Rhynchonelliforms + Craniiforms (+Linguliforms?). Rhynchonelliforms The position of kutorginids within the rhynchonelliform stem lineage has been tricky to resolve (Holmer, Zhang, Topper, Popov, &amp; Claybourn, 2018); we resolve them as paraphyletic with respect to Rhynconellata (which encompasses the obolellate Alisina), which is broadly in accord to previous proposals (Holmer et al., 2018). Chileids form the adelphiotaxon to this clade. Longtancunella (Z.-F. Zhang et al., 2011) nests crownwards of the protorthid Glyptoria, but stemward of the obolellid Alisina. Salanygolina has been interpreted as a stem-group rhynchonelliform based on its combination of paterinid and chileate features (Holmer, Pettersson Stolk, Skovsted, Balthasar, &amp; Popov, 2009). Our results position Salanygolina between paterinids and chileids, which directly corroborates this proposed phylogenetic position. Basal rhynchonellids are characterized by a circular umbonal perforation in the ventral valve, associated with a colleplax. Partly on this basis, the aberrant taxa Yuganotheca and Tomteluva plot close to Salanygolina, the three often forming a clade – though the reliability of this grouping is perhaps liable to change as additional data comes to light. Nevertheless, an interpretation of Yuganotheca as a stem-group brachiopod (Z.-F. Zhang et al., 2014) is difficult to reconcile with the increasingly well-constrained nature of the early brachiopod body plan. Linguliforms The reconstruction of Linguloformea comprising Linguloidea as sister to Discinoidea is as expected, though it is notable that Acrotretids and Siphonotretids plot more closely to Linguloidea than Discinoidea does. Lingulellotretids also sit within this lingulid grouping; a position in the phoronid stem lineage (advocated by Balthasar &amp; Butterfield, 2009) is not upheld. More novel is the reconstruction of the calcitic obolellid Mummpikia in the linguliform total group: a rhynchonelliform affinity has been assumed based on its calcitic mineralogy. This said, Balthasar (2008) has highlighted the similarities between obolellids and linguliform brachiopods, including sub-μm vertical canals and the detailed configuration of the posterior shell margin. Our analysis upholds the case for a linguliform affinity for Mummpikia; a calcitic shell seemingly arose through an independent change within this taxon As such, Mummpikia has no direct bearing on the origin of ‘Calciata’, save that shell mineralogy is perhaps less static than commonly assumed. More generally, our results identify Class Obolellata as polyphyletic: Alisina (Trematobolidae) plots within Rhynchonellata; Tomteluva is harder to place, but tends to group with Salanygolina stemwards of the chileids. Paterinids Paterinids have traditionally been placed within the Linguliforms on the basis of their phosphatic shell (Williams et al., 2007), which our analysis identifies as ancestral within the brachiopod crown group; our analysis places them within the Rhynchonelliforms instead. Characters supporting this position include the strophic hinge line, planar cardinal area, the absence of a pedicle nerve impression, and the morphology of the mantle canals. More generally, although some lingulids can be found which share more generic characters (e.g. shell growth direction) with paterinids, the particular combination of characters exhibited in paterinids does not occur anywhere in the linguliform lineage, but is more similar to that of basal rhynchonelliforms, particularly Salanygolina. Tommotiids Tommotiids represent a basal grade, paraphyletic to phoronids and crown-group brachiopods, in line with previous interpretations. Micrina and Mickwitzia are the most crownwards of the tommotiids, but beyond this, their position is somewhat difficult to pin down; certain analytical configruations reconstruct then as stem-brachiopods; others place them closer to the discinids, the lingulids or the craniiforms. Heliomedusa is commonly associated closely with Mickwitzia, reflecting the similarities emphasized by Holmer and Popov in Williams et al. (2007), but plots instead within the Craniiforms under certain analytical conditions, in line with earlier interpretations (Williams et al., 2000). Hyoliths Hyoliths are interpreted as stem-group Brachiopods, which refines the broader phylogenetic position proposed by Moysiuk et al. (2017). This is to say, they sit closer to brachiopods than the phoronids do, but no analysis places them within the Brachiopod crown group. Hyoliths thus represent derived tommotiids, and are the closest relatives to the Brachiopod crown group. References "],

Provenance of fossil material. Individuals from the Yaoying section are usually bigger, with a thicker body wall, and have a smaller ratio of apertural width to shell length than specimens from other areas. In the absence of other differentiating features, we consider these deviations to represent ecophenotypical variation within a single species, perhaps reflecting the increased energetics and predation pressure that accompany the shallower water depth reported at the Yaoying section (Zhao et al., 2012).
