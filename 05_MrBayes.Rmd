# Bayesian analysis

```{R, echo=FALSE}
files <- list.files('MrBayes', pattern='^hyo\\..*\\.t$', full.names=TRUE)

allTrees <- lapply(files, read.nexus)
nTrees <- length(allTrees[[1]])

postBurnin <- lapply(allTrees, function (x) x[ceiling(nTrees * 0.1):nTrees])
```

Bayesian search was conducted in MrBayes v3.2.6 [@Ronquist2012] using the Mk model [@Lewis2001] with a gamma parameter:

> lset coding=variable rates=gamma;

Branch length was drawn from a dirichlet prior distribution, which is less informative than an exponential model [@Rannala2012], but requires a prior mean tree length within about two orders of magnitude of the true value [@Zhang2012]. To satisfy this latter criterion, we specified the prior mean tree length to be equal to the length of the most parsimonious tree under equal weights, usinga Dirichlet prior with $α_T = 1$, $β_T = 1/$(_equal weights tree length_ / _number of characters_), $α = c = 1$:

> prset brlenspr = unconstrained: gammadir(1, 0.33, 1, 1);

Neomorphic and transformational characters [sensu @Sereno2007] were allocated to two separate partitions whose proportion of invariant characters and gamma shape parameters were allowed to vary independently:

> charset Neomorphic = `r paste(which(neomorphic), collapse=' ')`;
>
> charset Transformational = `r paste(which(!neomorphic), collapse=' ')`;
>
>
> partition chartype = 2: Neomorphic, Transformational;
>
> set partition = chartype;
>
>
> unlink shape=(all) pinvar=(all);


Neomorphic characters were not assumed to have a symmetrical transition rate – that is, the probability of the absent → present transition was allowed to differ from that of the present → absent transition, being drawn from a uniform prior:

> prset applyto=(1) symdirihyperpr=fixed(1.0);

Four MrBayes runs were executed, each sampling eight chains for 1 000 000 generations, with samples taken every 500 generations:

> mcmcp ngen=1000000 samplefreq=500 nruns=2 nchains=8;

The first 10% of samples were discarded as burn-in (`burninfrac=0.1`), and a posterior tree topology was derived from the combined posterior sample of both runs.

```{R, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Bayesian analysis, posterior probability > 50%"}
omit <- c("none")
 # 'Novocrania', 'Craniops', 'Ussunia', 'Gasconsia',
thinned <- c(lapply(postBurnin[[1]], drop.tip, omit),
             lapply(postBurnin[[2]], drop.tip, omit),
             lapply(postBurnin[[3]], drop.tip, omit),
             lapply(postBurnin[[4]], drop.tip, omit))
class(thinned) <- 'multiPhylo'
ColPlot(consensus(thinned, p=0.5))
ColMissing(omit)
```

```{R, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Bayesian analysis, posterior probability > 50%"}
omit <- c('Heliomedusa', 'Micrina', 'Mickwitzia',
          'Eoobolus', 'Clupeafumosus', 
          'Yuganotheca', 'Longtancunella', 'Tomteluva', 'Nisusia', 'Kutorgina')
thinned <- c(lapply(postBurnin[[1]], drop.tip, omit),
             lapply(postBurnin[[2]], drop.tip, omit),
             lapply(postBurnin[[3]], drop.tip, omit),
             lapply(postBurnin[[4]], drop.tip, omit))
class(thinned) <- 'multiPhylo'
ColPlot(consensus(thinned, p=0.5))
ColMissing(omit)
```

Convergence was indicated by PSRF = 1.00 and an average estimated sample size of > 500 for each parameter:

```{R, MrBayes parameter summary, echo=FALSE, asis=TRUE}
knitr::kable(read.table ('MrBayes/hyo.nex.pstat', skip=1, header=TRUE),
             caption="MrBayes parameter estimates (.pstat file)")
```

It's interesting to note that the clade of hyoliths + lingulellotretids (+ relatives) is resolved as a grade under Bayesian analysis.  

In parsimony analysis, these taxa are always resolved as a clade when inapplicable data is correctly handled; they instead resolve as a grade under certain conditions under the [standard Fitch](#TNT) algorithm (which mishandles inapplicable data).

We suggest that the failure of Bayesian analysis to recover this group as a clade may reflect inappropriate handling of inapplicable data in MrBayes, though at present (and until the algorithms used in a likelihood context are improved) it is difficult to test this hypothesis.

The same goes for the position of _Gasconsia_, which is widely held to have an affinity with the craniid brachiopods, and is recovered in such a position using the inapplicable-safe parsimony algorithm (but not always when the standard Fitch parsimony algorithm is used).
