Supplementary figures and tables referenced in the main text appear first. These are followed with a detailed discussion of analyses of the morphological dataset constructed to accompany , and their results. The results presented in the main paper employ the algorithm described by (2) for correct handling of inapplicable data in a parsimony setting. We explore how each character is reconstructed on an optimal tree. For completeness, we also document the results of standard Fitch parsimony analysis, and the results of Bayesian analysis, neither of which treat inapplicable data in a logically consistent fashion.

Table 1.1: Provenance of fossil material. Individuals from the Yaoying section are usually bigger, with a thicker body wall, and have a smaller ratio of apertural width to shell length than specimens from other areas. In the absence of other differentiating features, we consider these deviations to represent ecophenotypical variation within a single species, perhaps reflecting the increased energetics and predation pressure that accompany the shallower water depth reported at the Yaoying section (3).

Namacalathus was incorporated as a 38th taxon, but preliminary results did not uphold the homology of its potentially brachiozoan-like features. As such, we excluded it from our analysis due to its morphological distance from ingroup taxa, a likely source of long branch error. Dailyatia was instead selected as an outgroup as camenellans have been interpreted as the earliest diverging members of the Brachiozoa (4, 5). Characters are coded following the recommendations of (2): We have employed reductive coding, using a distinct state to mark character inapplicability. Character specifications follow the model of (6). We have distinguished between neomorphic and transformational characters (6) by reserving the token 0 to refer to the absence of a neomorphic character. The states of transformational characters are represented by the tokens 1, 2, 3, … We code the absence of neomorphic ontologically dependent characters (7) as absence, rather than inapplicability. The complete dataset can be viewed and downloaded at Morphobank (project 2800), where each character is defined and its coding for each taxon discussed. References "],
["treesearch.html", "2 Parsimony analysis 2.1 Search parameters 2.2 Analysis 2.3 Results", " 2 Parsimony analysis The phylogenetic dataset contains a considerable proportion of inapplicable codings (451/3959 = 11.4% of tokens), which are known to introduce error and bias to phylogenetic reconstruction when the Fitch algorithm is employed (2, 8). As such, we employed a new tree-scoring algorithm that correctly handles inapplicable data (2), implemented in the MorphyLib C library (9). We employed the R package TreeSearch v0.1.2 (10) to conduct phylogenetic tree search with this algorithm. 2.1 Search parameters Heuristic searches were conducted using the parsimony ratchet (11) under equal and implied weights (12). The consensus tree presented in the main manuscript represents a strict consensus of all trees that are most parsimonious under one or more of the concavity constants (k) 2, 3, 4.5, 7, 10.5, 16 and 24, an approach that has been shown to produce higher accuracy than equal weights at any given level of precision (13). 2.2 Analysis The R commands used to conduct the analysis are reproduced below.

Further citations for codings that are not discussed in the text can be viewed by browsing the morphological dataset on MorphoBank (project 2800). The Inapp R package (2) was used to map each character onto one of the most parsimonious trees (obtained under implied weighting, \\(k = 4.5\\)) in order to generate the indicative reconstructions displayed below. The most parsimonious reconstruction will of course vary depending on the topology on which it is plotted; the figures below are simply to facilitate interpretation. 3.1 Sclerites [1] Present in adult Character 1: Sclerites: Present in adult 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Plate-like (wider than tall) skeletal elements, whether mineralized or non-mineralized. The definition deliberately excludes setae (which are taller than wide). 3.2 Sclerites: Bivalved [2] Character 2: Sclerites: Bivalved 0: Scleritomous: without differentiated dorsal and ventral valves 1: Bivalved: scleritome dominated by prominent dorsal and ventral valve Neomorphic character. Scleritome dominated by prominent differentiated dorsal and ventral valves. [3] Accessory sclerites reduced Character 3: Sclerites: Bivalved: Accessory sclerites reduced 0: Accessory sclerites present 1: Accessory sclerites absent: two valves only Neomorphic character. Taxa in the bivalved condition may retain sclerites as small additional elements, such as the L-elements of Paterimitra (4). This character is treated as neomorphic, with accessory sclerites ancestrally present, recognizing the likely origin of brachiozoans (and Lophotrochozoans more generally) from a scleritomous organism. Coded as inapplicable in taxa that lack multiple skeletal elements. Haplophrentis carinatus: Coded as ambiguous to recognize the possibility that helens may correspond to L-elements of Paterimitra (14). Paterimitra: L-sclerites (15). [4] Hinge line shape Character 4: Sclerites: Bivalved: Hinge line shape 1: Astrophic 2: Strophic Transformational character. Botsfordia: Coded as dissociated in Williams et al. (16), appendix 2. Craniops: Astrophic: rounded posterior margin (17). Gasconsia: The straight posterior margin of Gasconsia contributes to an overall resemblance with the Chileids (18). Kutorgina chengjiangensis: Williams et al. (17) consider the hinge of Kutorgina to be stropic, whereas Bassett et al. (19) argue for an astropic interpretation – whilst noting that the arrangement is prominently different from other astrophic taxa. We therefore code this taxon as ambiguous. Longtancunella chengjiangensis: “Longtancunella has an oval to subcircular shell with a very short strophic hinge line” – (20). Mickwitzia muralensis: non-strophic. Micrina: See (21). Nisusia sulcata: “The strophic, articulated shells of the Kutorginata rotated on simple hinge mechanisms that are different from those of other rhynchonelliforms” (17). Novocrania: Craniides have a strophic posterior valve edge (22): Novocrania’s “dorsal posterior margin” is “straight” (17). Tomteluva perturbata: “Tomteluvid taxa all have a strongly ventribiconvex, astrophic shell with a unisulcate commissure” – (23), p5. Yuganotheca elegans: Not evident from fossil material; the possibility of a short strophic hinge line (as in Longtancunella) is difficult to discount. [5] Apophyses Character 5: Sclerites: Bivalved: Apophyses 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Many brachiopods, in addition to Micrina and others, bear tooth-like structures or processes that articulate the two primary valves. Caution must be applied before taxa are coded as “absent”, as teeth can be subtle and may be overlooked. Kutorginata don’t have teeth or dental sockets, but their shells are articulated by “two triangular plates formed by dorsal interarea, bearing oblique ridges on the inner sides” (17); this simple hinge mechanism is different from other rhynchonelliforms (17), but serves an equivalent purpose and is thus potentially homologous. We thus code kutorginids as present, using a subsequent character to capture difference in tooth morphology. Alisina: “Strophic articulation with paired, ventral denticles, composed of secondary shell” – definition of family Trematobolidae in (17). Clupeafumosus socialis: No articulating processes evident or reported by Topper et al. (24). Gasconsia: “Articulatory structure comprising ventral cardinal socket and dorsal hinge plate […] The shape of the shell probably correlates strongly with the unique type of articulation, which consists of a dorsal hinge plate that fits tightly into a cardinal socket in the ventral valve, with a concave homeodeltidium in the center of the ventral interarea” – (17), p.184, concerning order Trimerellida. Kutorgina chengjiangensis: “Articulation characterized by two triangular plates formed by dorsal interarea, bearing oblique ridges on the inner sides” – (17), p. 211. Mickwitzia muralensis: Not reported by or evident in Balthasar (25). Mummpikia nuda: No articulation structures are evident; instead, the propareas are rotated inwards (26). The definition of Family Obolellidae in Williams et al. (17) notes that articulation may be lacking or vestigial in the group. Nisusia sulcata: Pseudodont articulation: teeth formed by distal lateral extensions from the ventral pseudodeltidium – (27). Tomteluva perturbata: Tomteluvids […] lack articulation structures such as teeth and sockets (23). Ussunia: “articulatory structures poorly developed” – (17), p. 192. [6] Apophyses: Morphology Character 6: Sclerites: Bivalved: Apophyses: Morphology 1: Deltidiodont 2: Cyrtomatodont 3: Pseudodont Transformational character. Deltidiodont teeth are simple hinge teeth developed by the distal accretion of secondary shell; Cyrtomatodont teeth are knoblike or hook-shaped hinge teeth developed by differential secretion and resorption of the secondary shell (17). Kutorginata (here represented by Kutorgina and Nisusia) don’t have teeth (apophyses) or dental sockets, but their shells are articulated by “two triangular plates formed by dorsal interarea, bearing oblique ridges on the inner sides” (17); this simple hinge mechanism is different from other rhynchonelliforms [(17), p.208; table 13 character 30], and is described as a “pseudodont articulation” (27). Antigonambonites planus, Glyptoria: Coded as deltidiodont in Benedetto (28). Kutorgina chengjiangensis: “Articulation characterized by two triangular plates formed by dorsal interarea, bearing oblique ridges on the inner sides” – (17), p. 211. Micrina: The simple knob-like teeth of Micrina show no evidence of resprobtion or the hook-like shape that characterises Cyrtomatodont teeth. Nisusia sulcata: The ‘teeth’ are formed by the distal lateral extensions from the ventral pseudodeltidium fitting into the ‘sockets’ on the inner side of the dorsal interarea (27). [Coded as “deltidiodont teeth absent” in Benedetto (28).]. Orthis: Coded as deltidiodont (in Eoorthis) in Benedetto (28). Terebratulina: Cyrtomatodont – see fig. 322 in Williams et al. (17). [7] Apophyses: Dental plates Character 7: Sclerites: Bivalved: Apophyses: Dental plates 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. (29) (p362) write: “Teeth […] are commonly supported by a pair of variably disposed plates also built up exclusively of secondary shell and known as dental plates (Fig. 323.1, 323.3).” Dewing (30) elaborates: “Dental plates are near-vertical, narrow sheets of shell tissue between the anteromedian edge of the teeth and floor of the ventral valve. They are a composite structure, resulting from the growth of teeth over the ridge that bounds the ventral-valve muscle field.” (17) (p.201) write: “The denticles lack supporting structures in all Obolellida, but in Naukatida they are supported by an arcuate plate below the interarea, the anterise (Fig. 119.3a)”. The anterise is conceivably homologous with the dental plates, thus the presence of either is coded “present” for this character. Antigonambonites planus: Coded as present (well developed) in Benedetto (28). Coolinia pecten: Coded as present following Dewing (30), who seems to use the term Strophomenoids to encompass Coolinia, and attests to the presence of dental plates. Gasconsia: Coded ambiguous to reflect the possibility that the hinge plate in trimerellids is homologous to the dental plates of other taxa, and has replaced the teeth themselves as the primary articulatory mechanism (17). Glyptoria, Nisusia sulcata: Coded as absent in Benedetto (28). Orthis: Coded as present (short and recessive, in Eoorthis) in Benedetto (28). [8] Sockets Character 8: Sclerites: Bivalved: Sockets 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Simplified from Bassett et al. (19) character 16. This character is independent of apophyses, as several taxa bear sockets without corresponding teeth; the function of these sockets is unknown. See figs 323ff in Williams et al. (29). Alisina: “bearing sockets, bounded by low ridges” – (17). Antigonambonites planus: Coded as present in Benedetto (28). Gasconsia: “Articulatory structure comprising ventral cardinal socket and dorsal hinge plate” – (17), p. 184. Glyptoria, Nisusia sulcata: Coded as absent in Benedetto (28). Mickwitzia muralensis: Not reported by or evident in Balthasar (25). Tomteluva perturbata: Tomteluvids […] lack articulation structures such as teeth and sockets (23). Ussunia: Following table 15 in (17). [9] Socket ridges Character 9: Sclerites: Bivalved: Socket ridges 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. After Bassett et al. (19) character 17. May be difficult to distinguish from a brachiophore (29), so the two structures are not distinguished here. Alisina: “bearing sockets, bounded by low ridges” – (17). Antigonambonites planus: Coded as present in Benedetto (28). Glyptoria, Nisusia sulcata: Coded as absent in Benedetto (28). Tomteluva perturbata: Tomteluvids […] lack articulation structures such as teeth and sockets (23). [10] Enclosing filtration chamber Character 10: Sclerites: Bivalved: Enclosing filtration chamber 0: No filtration chamber, or open chamber 1: Shells close to form enclosed filtration chamber Neomorphic character. In crown-group brachiopods, the two primary shells close to form an enclosed filtration chamber. Further down the stem, taxa such as Micrina do not. [11] Commissure Character 11: Sclerites: Bivalved: Commissure 1: Rectimarginate 2: Uniplicate 3: Sulcate Transformational character. The anterior commissure can be rectimarginate (i.e. straight), uniplicate (i.e. median sulcus in ventral valve), or sulcate (with median sulcus in dorsal valve). Askepasma toddense: “ventral valve weakly to moderately sulcate” (31); a similar description is provided by Williams et al. (17). Glyptoria, Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Micromitra, Salanygolina: Following appendix 2 in Williams et al. (16). Terebratulina: “Anterior commissure rectimarginate to uniplicate” – uniplicate in fig. 1425.1c of Williams et al. (32). [12] Muscle scars: Ventral Character 12: Sclerites: Bivalved: Muscle scars: Ventral 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. After Bassett et al. (19) character 6. Alisina: Muscle scars scored based on Alisina comleyensis (19). Mickwitzia muralensis: Scars absent; instead, cones ornament shell’s internal surface. Micrina: Prominent ventral muscle scars – see e.g. (21), fig. 1f. [13] Muscle scars: Ventral: Position Character 13: Sclerites: Bivalved: Muscle scars: Ventral: Position 1: Posterolateral and medial attachments 2: Medial attachments only Transformational character. Muscles can attach to the ventral valve posterolaterally to, as well as between, the vascula lateralia (33). Acanthotretella spinosa: “Individual muscle scars cannot be distinguished” – (34). Alisina: Following reconstruction of Gorjansky &amp; Popov (35). Askepasma toddense: Restricted to medial field, following the interpretation of the musculature presented by Williams et al. (17), fig. 81. Clupeafumosus socialis: Coded following Hadrotreta, as illustrated in Popov (33). Craniops: See fig. 89 in Williams et al. (17). Eoobolus: The ‘laterals’ of Balthasar (36) are situated almost upon the vascula lateralia; they are interpreted as sitting posterolateral to them. Gasconsia: Musculature described in Hanken &amp; Harper (37). Glyptoria: Posterolateral reflected by diductor attachments; see fig. 18.3.2 in (19). Kutorgina chengjiangensis: Following situation in Nisusia; see fig. 18.2 in Bassett et al. (19). Lingulellotreta malongensis: See fig. 5 in (38). Micromitra: Posteriomedial muscle field (16) treated as equivalent to posterolateral muscles. Nisusia sulcata: Posterolateral diductors (19). Novocrania: Posterior adductor muscles attach posterolaterally to ventral mantle canal (39). Orthis: Not applicable: vascula lateralia not comparable to those of other taxa. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Inapplicable as vascular system not directly equivalent to the canonical; see. fig 6b in Balthasar (36). Salanygolina: Ventral musculature not clearly constrained (40). Siphonobolus priscus: Coded following general siphonotretid condition described by Popov (33). [14] Muscle scars: Adjustor Character 14: Sclerites: Bivalved: Muscle scars: Adjustor 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. After Bassett et al. (19) character 7. This character is contingent on the presence of a pedicle. Extreme caution must be used in inferring an absent state, as adjustor scars can be extremely difficult to distinguish from the adductor scars. Alisina: Muscle scars scored based on Alisina comleyensis (19). The presence of an adjustor is marked as not presently available, as it is not clear that a scar, if present, could be distinguished from the diminutive muscle scars present. Askepasma toddense: Following the interpretation of the musculature presented by Williams et al. (17), fig. 81. Botsfordia: Not described in Popov (33). Clupeafumosus socialis: Not known in any acrotretid (17); not evident in Clupeafumosus (24). Gasconsia: No mention of an adjustor muscle in Gasconsia or Trimerellida more generally on pp. 184–185 of (17), nor in discussion in (22) (p. 2850). Coded as absent. Mickwitzia muralensis: Scars absent; instead, cones ornament shell’s internal surface. Siphonobolus priscus: Ventral musculature poorly constrained (17, 41). [15] Muscle scars: Dorsal adductors Character 15: Sclerites: Bivalved: Muscle scars: Dorsal adductors 1: Dispersed 2: Radially arranged 3: Quadripartite Transformational character. After Bassett et al. (19) character 8, and Williams et al. [(42), character 35; 2000, p. 160, character 54] In the dorsal valve, the anterior and posterior adductor scars of articulated brachiopods form a single (quadripartite) muscle field (17) In contrast, the anterior and posterior scars of e.g. trimerellids have prominently separate attachment points, with anterior and posterior muscle fields clearly distinct, and coded as “dispersed”. In e.g. kutorginates, adductor muscles are separated into left and right fields; the same is the case in lingulids, where there are more separate muscle groups and the left and right fields conspire to produce a radial arrangement; both of these configurations are scored as “radially arranged”. Alisina: Following Williams et al. (17) table 15 (their character 54). Antigonambonites planus: Treatise. Askepasma toddense: Separate left and right fields, so radially arranged – following the interpretation of the musculature presented by Williams et al. (17), fig. 81. Botsfordia: Following (16), appendix 2. Clupeafumosus socialis: Following reconstruction of Hadrotreta by Williams (17), fig. 51, which exhibits distinct left and right fields. Coolinia pecten: “radially arranged adductor scars” – (43), p1. Gasconsia: Following the coding of Williams et al. (17), table 15. Glyptoria: Scored as “dispersed” by Williams et al. (16) … but then so is Kutorgina, which Bassett et al. (19) score as radial. Williams et al. (17) state, for superfamily Protorthida, “dorsal adductor scars probably linear”, which fits in the category of “radial” employed herein – so that’s what we follow. Haplophrentis carinatus: Laterally dispersed, based on interpretation of Moysiuk et al. (14), and consistent with general situation in hyoliths (44). Heliomedusa orienta: Distinct anterior and posterior fields (45); coded as “dispersed” by Williams et al. (17) in table 15. Mickwitzia muralensis: Scars absent; instead, cones ornament shell’s internal surface. Micromitra: Williams et al. (16) code as “dispersed”, but have a less divided scheme of character states and disagree with other sources in some codings (19). Williams et al. (17) do not describe Micromitra musculature and we were unable to find any reliable description of the scars, so we code as “not presently available”. Novocrania: Craniids scored as “open, quadripartite” by Williams et al. (42). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Discinids scored as “open, quadripartite” by Williams et al. (42). Salanygolina: “The dorsal valve of Salanygolina has a radial arrangement of adductor muscle scars and the scars of posteromedially placed internal oblique muscles, which are also characteristic of paterinates and chileates” – Holmer et al. (40). Siphonobolus priscus: Ventral musculature poorly constrained (17, 41). Terebratulina: Coded as “grouped, quadripartite” by Williams et al. (42). Ussunia: Following table 15 in (17). [16] Muscle scars: Adductors: Position Character 16: Sclerites: Bivalved: Muscle scars: Adductors: Position 1: Oblique 2: At high angle Transformational character. Position of adductor muscles relative to commissural plane. After Bassett et al. (19) character 11. Askepasma toddense: Following the interpretation of the musculature presented by Williams et al. (17), fig. 81. Botsfordia: Following description of Popov (33). Coolinia pecten: Not reported by Williams et al. (17), nor Bassett &amp; Popov (43), nor explicitly by Dewing (30). Eoobolus: “Eoobolus should have anterior and posterior adductors and a variety of oblique muscles which were probably arranged in criss-crossing pairs” – (36). Gasconsia: See discussion under Trimerellida in Williams et al. (17). Mickwitzia muralensis: Scars absent; instead, cones ornament shell’s internal surface. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Musculature considered essentially equivalent to Lingula by (17), so Lingula coding followed here. Siphonobolus priscus: Ventral musculature poorly constrained (17, 41). [17] Muscle scars: Dermal muscles Character 17: Sclerites: Bivalved: Muscle scars: Dermal muscles 0: Absent or weakly developed 1: Strongly developed Neomorphic character. Based on character 11 in Zhang et al. (46). Well developed dermal muscles present in the body wall of recent lingulates, which are absent in all calcareous-shelled brachiopods. These muscles are responsible for the hydraulic shell-opening mechanism, and possibly present in all organophosphatic-shelled brachiopods, with the possible exception of the paterinates (17). Alisina, Antigonambonites planus, Gasconsia, Glyptoria, Nisusia sulcata, Orthis, Salanygolina: According to the statement of Williams et al. (17) that these muscle are absent in all carbonate- shelled brachiopods. Askepasma toddense: According to the statement of Williams et al. (17) that the presence of these muscles in paterinates is uncertain. Botsfordia: Implicitly taken as present in Popov (33), though not marked in diagrams – suggesting not strongly developed. Clupeafumosus socialis: This character is coded based on the score of Acrotreta in Zhang et al. (46), and statement in Williams et al. (17). Coolinia pecten: According to the statement of Williams et al. (17) that these muscle are absent in all carbonate-shelled brachiopods. Eoobolus: Not remarked upon by Balthasar (36). Kutorgina chengjiangensis: According to the statement of Williams et al. (17) that these muscle are absent in all carbonate- shelled brachiopods, and the coding for kutorginids in Zhang et al. (46). Micromitra: Williams et al. (17) are uncertain about the presence of these muscles in the paterinates. Zhang et al. (46) code absence in Paterinida, but without specifying evidence; we follow their coding here. Mummpikia nuda, Tomteluva perturbata: Though Williams et al. (17) state that these muscles are absent in all carbonate-shelled brachiopods, their existence cannot be discounted with certainty in this taxon, which is therefore coded not presently available. Novocrania: Following Zhang et al. (46), and the statement of Williams et al. (17) that such muscles are absent in all calcite-shelled brachiopods. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Musculature considered essentially equivalent to Lingula by (17), so Lingula coding followed here. Siphonobolus priscus: Ventral musculature poorly constrained (17, 41). Terebratulina: Williams et al. (17) state that these muscles are absent in all carbonate-shelled brachiopods. [18] Muscle scars: Unpaired median (levator ani) Character 18: Sclerites: Bivalved: Muscle scars: Unpaired median (levator ani) 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. The levator ani is a diminutive unpaired medial muscle found in certain calcitic brachiopods [(17); see fig. 89, character 34 in table 13]. Alisina, Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Nisusia sulcata: Following table 13 in (17). Coolinia pecten: Not reported in Dewing (30). Craniops: See fig. 90 in (17). Gasconsia: (17) code an unpaired medial muscle scar as present in their table 13, but give no reference for this coding, which perhaps arises from their interpretation of the taxon as a trimerellid. Hanken and Harper (37) explicitly identify a pair of central muscles, so we code a levator ani as absent. Heliomedusa orienta: Poor preservation of minor muscle scars noted by Chen et al. (45). Mickwitzia muralensis: Scars absent; instead, cones ornament shell’s internal surface. Novocrania: Following table 13 in (17) (for Novocrania). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Musculature considered essentially equivalent to Lingula by (17), so Lingula coding followed here. Siphonobolus priscus: Ventral musculature poorly constrained (17, 41). Ussunia: Following table 15 in (17). [19] Muscle scars: Dorsal diductor Character 19: Sclerites: Bivalved: Muscle scars: Dorsal diductor 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. After Bassett et al. (19) character 9. Acanthotretella spinosa: Not observable in Acanthotretella itself, so coded as ambiguous – though it is likely based on the anticipated phylogenetic affinities of Acanthotretella that the muscles are absent. Askepasma toddense: Not reconstructed in the the interpretation of the musculature presented by Williams et al. (17), fig. 81, but presence cannot be confidently excluded. Clupeafumosus socialis: Not reported by Topper et al. (24), nor reconstructed in generic acrotretid by Williams et al. (17). Gasconsia: Internal oblique muscles serve as diductors. Siphonobolus priscus: Ventral musculature poorly constrained (17, 41). [20] Muscle scars: Dorsal diductor: Position Character 20: Sclerites: Bivalved: Muscle scars: Dorsal diductor: Position 1: Close to commissural plane 2: Oblique to commissural plane 3: At high angle to commissural plane Transformational character. After Bassett et al. (19) character 10. Siphonobolus priscus: Ventral musculature poorly constrained (17, 41). 3.3 Sclerites: Dorsal valve [21] Growth direction Character 21: Sclerites: Dorsal valve: Growth direction 1: Holoperipheral 2: Mixoperipheral 3: Hemiperipheral Transformational character. See Fig. 284 in Williams et al. (29). The growth direction dictates the attitude of the cardinal area relative to the hinge, which does not therefore represent an independent character. Crudely put, if, viewed from a dorsal position, the umbo falls within the outer margin of the shell, growth is holoperipheral; if it falls outside the margin, it is mixoperipheral; if it falls exactly on the margin, it is hemiperipheral. Clupeafumosus socialis: Appears hemiperipheral in fig. 3 in Topper et al. (24), though bordering on holoperipheral, so scored as ambiguous. Craniops: “both valves with growth holoperipheral” – (17) p164. Heliomedusa orienta: “holoperipheral growth in dorsal valve” – (22). The insinuation from Zhang et al. (47) is that Chen et al. (45) misidentify the dorsal valve as the ventral valve. Micrina: See Holmer et al. (21). Paterimitra: S2 and L sclerites are clearly holoperipheral. See (48), fig. 2. Ussunia: Following description of order in (17). [22] Posterior surface: Differentiated Character 22: Sclerites: Dorsal valve: Posterior surface: Differentiated 0: Posterior shell not differentiated 1: Posterior shell forms distinct cardinal area or pseudointerarea Neomorphic character. In shells that grow by mixoperipheral growth, the triangular area subtended between each apex and the posterior ends of the lateral margins is termed the cardinal area. In shells with holoperipheral growth, a flattened surface on the posterior margin of the valve is termed a pseudointerarea (29). In order for this character to be independent of a shell’s growth direction, we do not distinguish between a “cardinal area”, “interarea” or “pseudointerarea”. Acanthotretella spinosa: Pseudointerarea present, following Siphonotretidae coding in Williams et al. (17), table 6. Alisina, Antigonambonites planus, Coolinia pecten, Glyptoria, Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Orthis, Salanygolina, Tomteluva perturbata: Cardinal area (interarea) present. Askepasma toddense: Well-defined pseudointerarea (17). Botsfordia: “dorsal pseudointerarea vestigial, divided by median groove” – (17). Clupeafumosus socialis: Pseudointerarea present; figured by Topper et al. (24), fig. 3j. Craniops: “Only some craniopsids (Lingulapholis, Pseudopholidops [not Craniops]) have well-developed pseudointerareas.” – (17). Gasconsia: Absent: the dorsal (branchial) pseudointerarea of G. schucherti is “reduced or obsolete”; that of G. worsleyi “short, virtually obsolete” (37). Haplophrentis carinatus: A very short pseudointerarea appears to be present (14). Heliomedusa orienta: Pseudointerea in ventral valve, but not dorsal valve (17). Lingula, Lingulellotreta malongensis: Pseudointerarea present, following Williams et al. (17), table 6. Lingulosacculus: Unclear from fossil material. Longtancunella chengjiangensis: Zhang et al. (20) note that “all evidence of a pseudointerarea is lacking”, but the two-dimensional preservation style of Chengjiang material makes details of dorsal valve difficult to distinguish, and the possibility of a diminutive pseudointerarea cannot be excluded with total confidence. Mickwitzia muralensis: Shell flat. Micrina: = Sellate sclerite duplicature (21). Micromitra: “Dorsal pseudointerarea usually well defined, low, anacline to catacline” – (17). Mummpikia nuda: “Information on the dorsal interarea is inconclusive […] no obvious interarea is recognisable; whether or not this is the primary state or a taphonomic artefact is difficult to assess” – (26), p. 276. Nisusia sulcata: Cardinal area (interarea) present – with reference to Holmer et al. (27). Novocrania, Paterimitra, Pedunculotheca diania: Pseudointerarea. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Absent, following entry for Discinidae in Williams et al. (17), table 6. Siphonobolus priscus: “Dorsal pseudointerarea weakly anacline, undivided, elevated above the valve floor” – (41). Terebratulina: Interarea present. Ussunia: Following table 15 in (17). Yuganotheca elegans: A differentiated region is not obvious in fossil material or its reconstruction (46), but the two-dimensional preservation style of Chengjiang material makes details of dorsal valve difficult to distinguish, and the possibility of a diminutive pseudointerarea cannot be excluded with confidence. [23] Differentiated posterior surface: Morphology Character 23: Sclerites: Dorsal valve: Differentiated posterior surface: Morphology 0: Curved lateral profile 1: Planar lateral profile Neomorphic character. It is possible for a cardinal area or pseudointerarea to be distinct from the anterior part of the shell, yet to remain curved in lateral profile. Taking an undifferentiated posterior margin as primitive, the primitive condition is curved – flattening of the posterior margin represents an additional modification that can only occur once the posterior margin is differentiated. Botsfordia: “Curved pseudointerarea” – (49). Clupeafumosus socialis: Truncated but essentially planar surface; see e.g. p196 of (24). Eoobolus: Essentially planar; see Balthasar (36), fig. 4a. Gasconsia, Heliomedusa orienta, Mickwitzia muralensis, Pelagodiscus atlanticus, Ussunia: Posterior surface cannot be flat if it is not differentiated. Micromitra: Essentially straight; see fig. 3.7 in (50). Pedunculotheca diania: Difficult to evaluate based on present material, given low nature of valve and compressed preservation. Siphonobolus priscus: The short interarea appears planar (see for example Popov et a. 2009 fig. 6A), but its short length makes it difficult to establish whether slight curvature is present. [24] Posterior surface: Medial groove Character 24: Sclerites: Dorsal valve: Posterior surface: Medial groove 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Following character 29 in Williams et al. (17), table 9 (which relates to pseudointerarea). Acanthotretella spinosa: The dorsal pseudointerarea is poorly preserved, but appears to have a median groove (34). Botsfordia: “dorsal pseudointerarea vestigial, divided by median groove” – (17). Clupeafumosus socialis: Present; figured by Topper et al. (24), fig. 3j. Eoobolus: Prominent medial groove (36). Heliomedusa orienta: “A posteriorly protruding dorsal pseudointerarea with no median groove and no flexure lines” – (45). Lingulellotreta malongensis: Dorsal pseudointerarea with wide, concave median groove and short propareas&quot; – (17). Siphonobolus priscus: The dorsal pseudointerarea of S. priscus is undivided (41), but in other species it is divided by a “wide, poorly defined median groove” (17). Coded, therefore, as polymorphic. [25] Posterior surface: Notothyrium Character 25: Sclerites: Dorsal valve: Posterior surface: Notothyrium 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. A notothyrium is an opening in an interarea that accommodates the pedicle, and may be filled with plates. Botsfordia: Following (16), appendix 2. Longtancunella chengjiangensis: No evidence or report of an opening at the hinge line in fossil material in (51) or (20). [26] Posterior surface: Notothyrium: Shape Character 26: Sclerites: Dorsal valve: Posterior surface: Notothyrium: Shape 1: Parallel-sided cleft 2: Triangular Transformational character. A notothyrium is an opening in an interarea that accommodates the pedicle, and may be filled with plates. A simplification of character 5 in (19). [27] Posterior surface: Notothyrium: Chilidial plates Character 27: Sclerites: Dorsal valve: Posterior surface: Notothyrium: Chilidial plates 1: Open 2: Covered by chilidial plates Transformational character. A notothyrium may be open or covered by a chilidium or two chilidial plates. No included taxa exhibit more than one chilidial plate. Transformational as it is not self-evident whether the ancestral taxon had an open or closed notothyrium. [28] Notothyrial platform Character 28: Sclerites: Dorsal valve: Notothyrial platform 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. After Bassett et al. (19) character 12. The presence or absence of a notothyrial platform, which often serves as an attachment point for the diductors in a similar fashion to the cardinal processes, is independent of the presence of a notothyrium. Alisina, Glyptoria: Bassett et al. (19) score as present in Table 18.1. Coolinia pecten: Referred to as the “posterior platform” in Dewing (30). Kutorgina chengjiangensis: “Dorsal diductor scars impressed on floor of notothyrial cavity”: (17), regarding Kutorginata. Bassett et al. (19) score as absent in Table 18.1. Nisusia sulcata: Bassett et al. (19) score as absent in Table 18.1. “Dorsal diductor scars impressed on floor of notothyrial cavity”: (17), regarding Kutorginata. Ussunia: “Visceral platforms absent in both valves” – (17), p. 192. [29] Cardinal shield Character 29: Sclerites: Dorsal valve: Cardinal shield 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. A prominent platform in the hyolith operculum. With no obvious sites for muscle attachment, it is unlikely to be homologous to the notothyrial platform. [30] Cardinal processes Character 30: Sclerites: Dorsal valve: Cardinal processes 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. After Bassett et al. (19) character 13. Cardinal processes are unlikely to be homologous with the notothyrial platform, even if their function is similar. Clupeafumosus socialis: Not reported by Topper et al. (24). Longtancunella chengjiangensis: Not evident, and ought arguably to be discernable if present given the quality of preservation. [31] Medial septum Character 31: Sclerites: Dorsal valve: Medial septum 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. The dorsal valve of many taxa is exhibits a septum or process (or myophragm) along the medial line. See character 25 in Benedetto (28). Acanthotretella spinosa: Not described by Holmer &amp; Caron (34), but an unannotated linear feature corresponds to the position of a median septum. Without detailed study of the specimen, we opt to score this as ambiguous. Antigonambonites planus: Weakly developed septum evident in internal cast: (17), fig. 508.2e. Botsfordia: “dorsal interior with narrow anterior projection extending to midvalve, bisected by median ridge” – (17). Clupeafumosus socialis: Prominent process evident (24). Eoobolus: A “median projection” is present (36). Glyptoria: Neither evident nor reported in Williams et al. (17). Heliomedusa orienta: Reported on ‘ventral’ valve by Chen et al. (45); we consider their ‘ventral’ valve to be the dorsal valve. The structure is unambiguously figured (45), contra its coding as absent in (17) and its lack of mention in (22) or (47). Kutorgina chengjiangensis: Absent – fig. 129.1f in Williams et al. (17). Lingulellotreta malongensis: Very weakly developed but seemingly present between muscle scars in Lingulellotreta, more prominent in Aboriginella (also Lingulellotretidae) (17). Lingulosacculus: It is not possible to determine, based on the material presented in Balthasar &amp; Butterfield (52), whether the anterior projection of the visceral area in the dorsal valve corresponds to a medial septum in the underlying shell. Mummpikia nuda: See pl. 2 panel 6 in Balthasar (26). Nisusia sulcata: Fig. 125 in Williams et al. (17). Novocrania: Median process evident: Williams et al. (17) fig. 100.2a, d. Orthis: Short medial process (“low median ridge”, p. 724) present in dorsal valve; see Fig. 523.3b in Williams et al. (17). Siphonobolus priscus: “Dorsal interior […] bisected by a short median ridge.” – (41). Ussunia: Following char 42 in table 15 in (17). [32] Clavicles Character 32: Sclerites: Dorsal valve: Clavicles 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Prominent symmetrical ridges on the inner surface of the hyolith operculum. 3.4 Sclerites: Ventral valve [33] Relative size Character 33: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Relative size 1: Ventral valve markedly larger than dorsal valve (ventribiconvex) 2: Equivalve (subequally biconvex) 3: Dorsal valve markedly larger than ventral valve (dorsibiconvex) Transformational character. In many brachiopods, the valves are closely similar in size; in others, the ventral valve is markedly larger than the dorsal, on account of being more convex. Marginal cases are treated as ambiguous for the relevant states. Antigonambonites planus: Broadly equivalve – see Williams et al. (17) fig. 508.2c. Botsfordia: After table 8 in Williams et al. (17). Craniops: “Shell subequally biconvex” – (17). Eoobolus: “Eoobolus is biconvex”, but in his amended diagnosis, Balthasar (36) described it as “shell inequivalved, dorsibiconvex”. Gasconsia: Convexiplane (17). Heliomedusa orienta: Ventral valve larger than the dorsal valve (47). Kutorgina chengjiangensis: Ventral valve larger (17). Longtancunella chengjiangensis, Yuganotheca elegans: The ventral valve is somewhat, but not markedly, larger than the dorsal; as such, this character is coded ambiguous for equivalve/ventral valve larger. Mummpikia nuda: Aside from hinge, valves similar in convexity and size (26). Nisusia sulcata: Ventral valve larger (17). Siphonobolus priscus: Ventribiconvex (41). Ussunia: Subequally biconvex (17). [34] Growth direction Character 34: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Growth direction 1: Holoperipheral 2: Mixoperipheral 3: Hemiperipheral Transformational character. See Fig. 284 in Williams et al. (29) for depiction of terms. The growth direction dictates the attitude of the cardinal area relative to the hinge, which does not therefore represent an independent character. Crudely put, if, viewed from a dorsal position, the umbo falls within the outer margin of the shell, growth is holoperipheral; if it falls outside the margin, it is mixoperipheral; if it falls exactly on the margin, it is hemiperipheral. Clupeafumosus socialis: Inferred from Topper et al. (24). Heliomedusa orienta: Williams et al. (17) reconstruct mixoperipheral growth in the ventral valve [though Chen et al. (45) reconstruct the valves the other way round, i.e. it is the ventral valve that grows holoperipherally, and the dorsal mixoperipherally]. Paterimitra: The apical flange notwithstanding, the umbo of the S1 sclerite is posterior of the hinge line and the posterior edge of the lateral plate – see (48), fig. 2a, c. Siphonobolus priscus: Initially holoperipheral (41), then on the brink of being mixoperipheral in adulthood, so coded as polymorphic. Ussunia: Following description of order in (17). [35] Posterior surface: Differentiated Character 35: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Posterior surface: Differentiated 0: Posterior surface of shell not differentiated 1: Posterior surface of shell forms distinct cardinal area or pseudointerarea Neomorphic character. In shells that grow by mixoperipheral growth, the triangular area subtended between each apex and the posterior ends of the lateral margins is termed the cardinal area. In shells with holoperipheral growth, a flattened surface on the posterior margin of the valve is termed a pseudointerarea (29). In order for this character to be independent of a shell’s growth direction, we do not distinguish between a “cardinal area”, “interarea” or “pseudointerarea”. Alisina, Antigonambonites planus, Coolinia pecten, Glyptoria, Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Nisusia sulcata, Orthis, Salanygolina, Tomteluva perturbata: Interarea present. Clupeafumosus socialis: Described by Topper et al. (24). Gasconsia: The region corresponding to the ventral (pseudo)interarea is described as a “trimerellid ventral cardinal area” by Williams et al. (17), who code both an interarea and a pseudointerarea as absent in trimerellids. Heliomedusa orienta: Zhang et al. (47) report a moderate to somewhat developed ventral pseudointerarea, confirmed by Williams et al. (22). Lingulosacculus: The conical valve is interpreted as the ventral valve with an extended pseudointerarea. Longtancunella chengjiangensis: Though “all evidence of a pseudointerarea is lacking” – (20) – the region of the shell between the strophic hinge line and the colleplax (20) is distinct from the rest of the shell; the ends of the strophic hinge line are marked by prominent nicks in the shell margin. Longtancunella is therefore coded as having a differentiated posterior surface. Mickwitzia muralensis: Termed an interarea by Balthasar (25). Mummpikia nuda: Balthasar (26) interprets a pseudointerarea as being present – e.g. p273, “Of particular interest is the vault that bridges the most anterior portion of the ventral pseudointerarea and raises it above the visceral platform.”; “This pattern is reversed in the ventral valves of M. nuda, where the anterior projection of the pedicle groove is raised above the valve floor whereas the lateral parts of pseudointerarea are not”. Paterimitra: Triangular notch and subapical flange. Siphonobolus priscus: “Ventral pseudointerarea, low, undivided, poorly defined” – (17). Terebratulina: Interarea. Ussunia: Following char 17 in table 15 in (17). [36] Posterior margin growth direction Character 36: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Posterior margin growth direction 1: Inward-growing 2: Outward-growing Transformational character. Balthasar (26) notes an inward-growing posterior margin of the pseudointerarea as potentially linking Mummpikia with the linguliform brachiopods. Coded as inapplicable in taxa without a differentiated posterior margin: the posterior margin can only grow inwards if it is differentiated from the anterior margin; else the entire shell would grow in on itself. Botsfordia: Inward-growing; see Skovsted &amp; Holmer (53), pl. 4. Clupeafumosus socialis: See Topper et al. (24). Eoobolus: See for example Skovsted &amp; Holmer (53), pl. 3. Lingulellotreta malongensis: Transverse cross section of ventral pseudointerarea concave. Mummpikia nuda: Balthasar (26) interprets an inward-growing posterior margin of the pseudointerarea – e.g. p273, “Of particular interest is the vault that bridges the most anterior portion of the ventral pseudointerarea and raises it above the visceral platform […] An inward-growing posterior margin is otherwise known only from the pseudointerareas of linguliform brachiopods”. [37] Posterior surface: Planar Character 37: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Posterior surface: Planar 0: Curved lateral profile 1: Planar lateral profile Neomorphic character. It is possible for a cardinal area or pseudointerarea to be distinct from the anterior part of the shell, yet to remain curved in lateral profile. Taking an undifferentiated posterior margin as primitive, the primitive condition is curved – flattening of the posterior margin represents an additional modification that can only occur once the posterior margin is differentiated. A flat and triangular interarea links Mummpikia with the Obolellidae (26) – but all included taxa have triangular interareas, so this is not listed as a separate character. Acanthotretella spinosa: ventral pseudointerareas are most similar to those found within the Order Siphonotretida. Botsfordia: See Skovsted &amp; Holmer (53), pl. 3, fig. 14. Clupeafumosus socialis: “Ventral pseudointerarea is gently procline and is flat in lateral profile”. — (24). Eoobolus: Some curvature retained. Lingulellotreta malongensis: Transverse cross section of ventral pseudointerarea concave. Longtancunella chengjiangensis: Flattened, reflecting the strophic hinge line. Micromitra: Essentially planar; see fig. 6 in (50). Siphonobolus priscus: ‘Almost’ planar – see Popov et al. (41). Coded as ambiguous. [38] Posterior surface: Extent Character 38: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Posterior surface: Extent 1: Low 2: High Transformational character. Distinguishes taxa whose ventral valve is essentially flat from those that are essentially conical. Antigonambonites planus: Though scored High in data matrix of Benedetto (28), this taxon (17) does not express the deeply conical ventral valve that this character is intended to reflect. It is charitably coded as ambiguous. Clupeafumosus socialis: Entire valve length – see schematic in Williams et al. (29), fig. 286. Coolinia pecten: See fig. 485 in (17). Gasconsia: “ventral cardinal interarea low, apsacline, with narrow, poorly defined homeodeltidium” – (17), p. 186. Kutorgina chengjiangensis: This taxon (17, 33) comes close to expressing the deeply conical ventral valve that this character is intended to reflect, though this is not always so pronounced (17). It is therefore coded as ambiguous. Mickwitzia muralensis: Often not prominently high (25, 54), though in some cases (55) the ventral valve approaches the conical shape that this character is intended to capture. Coded as polymorphic. Nisusia sulcata: Scored as high in data matrix of Benedetto (28), and depicted as such in Williams et al. (17) and Popov (33); but not high in all specimens (17). It is therefore coded as polymorphic. Orthis: Scored ‘Low’ for Eoorthis by Benedetto (28); assumed same in Orthis. Salanygolina: Whereas Williams et al. (17) describe the ventral pseudointerarea as high, the shell lacks the deeply conical aspect that this character is intended to capture; we thus code the taxon as ambiguous. [39] Posterior surface: Delthyrium Character 39: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Posterior surface: Delthyrium 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. A delthyrium is an opening in an interarea or pseudointerarea that accommodates the pedicle, and may be filled with plates. The homology of the pedicle in the pseudointerarea of obolellids and botsfordiids with the umbonal pedicle foramen of acrotretids was proposed by Popov (33), and seemingly corroborated by observations of Ushatinskaya &amp; Korovnikov (56), who note that the propareas of the Botsfordia ventral valve sometimes merge to form an elongate teardrop-shaped pedicle foramen. Acanthotretella spinosa: Origin modelled on Siphonobolus. Askepasma toddense: Homeodeltidium absent (17); deltidium is open (31). Botsfordia: The homology of the triangular notch or groove in the pseudointerarea with the umbonal pedicle foramen of acrotretids was proposed by Popov (33), and seemingly corroborated by observations of Ushatinskaya &amp; Korovnikov (56), who note that the propareas of the Botsfordia ventral valve sometimes merge to form an elongate teardrop-shaped pedicle foramen. Clupeafumosus socialis: Following Popov (33), the larval delthyrium is sealed in adults by outgrowths of the posterolateral margins of the shell. Eoobolus: See for example fig. 5 in (36). Glyptoria: “Delthyrium and notothyrium open, wide” – (57). Longtancunella chengjiangensis: Unclear: a narrow ridge that may correspond to a pseudodeltidium evident in fig 2a and sketched in fig. 2c is not discussed in the text of (20), so the delthyrial region is coded as ambiguous. Mickwitzia muralensis: A delthyrium is present in young individuals (25). Micrina: Opening inferred by Holmer et al. (21). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: The listrum (pedicle opening) is interpreted as originating via a similar mechanism to that of acrotretids (33), and hence corresponding to a basally sealed delthyrium. Siphonobolus priscus: Ontogeny presumed to resemble that of acrotretids. Yuganotheca elegans: Details of the hinge region are unclear due to the flattened and overprinted nature of fossil preservation. [40] Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Shape Character 40: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Shape 1: Parallel sided 2: Triangular 3: Round Transformational character. A parallel-sided delthyrium links Mummpikia with the Obolellidae (26). Following Popov (33), the larval delthyrium of acrotretids and allied taxa is understood to be sealed in adults by outgrowths of the posterolateral margins of the shell. The resultant round or teardrop-shaped foramen corresponds the delthyrium. Askepasma toddense: Prominently triangular (31). Clupeafumosus socialis: Following the model of Popov (33). Mickwitzia muralensis: An opening is incorporated at the base of the homeodeltidium when the organism switches from early to late maturity (25). This opening is conceivably homologous with the pedicle foramen of acrotretid brachiopods and their ilk. To reflect this possible homology, Mickwitzia is coded as polymorphic (triangular/round). [41] Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Shape: Aspect of rounded opening Character 41: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Shape: Aspect of rounded opening 1: Elongate: oval to rhombic 2: Essentially circular 3: Wider than long Transformational character. Chen et al. (45) propose that an oval to rhombic foramen characterises the discinids [and Heliomedusa, though the foramen in this taxon has since been reinterpreted by Zhang et al. (47) as an impression of internal tissue]. Lingulellotreta malongensis: Oval (17). Mickwitzia muralensis: Wider than long: see fig. 10 in (25). [42] Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Cover Character 42: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Cover 1: Open 2: Covered, at least in part Transformational character. An open delthyrium links Mummpikia with the Obolellidae (26). The delthyrial opening can be covered by one or more deltidial plates, or a pseudodeltitium. Inapplicable in taxa with a round delthiruym (33). Askepasma toddense: Open (31). Botsfordia: See pl. 3 fig. 15 in Skovsted &amp; Holmer (53). Coolinia pecten: A convex pseudodeltidium completely covers the delthyrium in Coolinia. Glyptoria: Coded as open by Williams et al. (16). Nisusia sulcata: “Covered only apically by a small convex pseudodeltitium” – (27). Paterimitra: Covered by subaical flange, in part. [43] Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Cover: Extent Character 43: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Cover: Extent 1: Covered only partially; partially open 2: Completely covered Transformational character. Micrina: Remains somewhat open. Nisusia sulcata: A well-defined pseudo-deltidium […] closes only the apical part of the delthyrium (58). [44] Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Cover: Identity Character 44: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Cover: Identity 1: Pseudodeltidium 2: Deltidial plate(s) Transformational character. This character has the capacity for further resolution (one or more deltidial plates), but this is unlikely to affect the results of the present study. The pseudodelthyrium is also referred to as a homeodeltidium. Alisina: Stated as “concave pseudodeltidium with median plication” – (17) Coded as “Pseudodeltidium: Covered by concave plate” by Bassett et al. (19). Askepasma toddense: No pseudodeltidium (17). Lingulellotreta malongensis: The subapical flange of the Paterimitra S1 sclerite has been homologised with the ventral homeodeltidium of Micromitra (48). Mickwitzia muralensis: Termed a homoedeltidium by Balthasar (25). Micrina: “Ventral valve convex with apsacline interarea bearing delthyrium, covered by a convex pseudodeltidium” – (21). [45] Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Pseudodeltidium: Shape Character 45: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Pseudodeltidium: Shape 1: Concave 2: Convex Transformational character. A ridge-like (i.e. convex) pseudodeltitium unites Salanygolina with Coolinia and other Chileata (40). Alisina: “concave pseudodeltidium with median plication” – (17) Coded as “Pseudodeltidium: Covered by concave plate” by Bassett et al. (19). Antigonambonites planus: Convex (17). Gasconsia: Gasconsia possesses narrow concave homeodeltidium, but absent pseudodeltidium. Kutorgina chengjiangensis: Difficult to determine based on material presented in Zhang et al. (59), or indeed for other species in the genus (17, 53, 60). Mickwitzia muralensis: Convex (25). Micrina: Convex deltoid (21). Micromitra: Gently convex (17). Nisusia sulcata: Convex in Nisusia (58). Paterimitra: Gently convex (17). Salanygolina: “The presence of […] a narrow delthyrium covered by a convex pseudodeltidium, places Salanygolinidae outside the Class Paterinata and strongly suggests affinity to the Cambrian Chileida” – (40), p. 9. Tomteluva perturbata: Convex (23). [46] Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Pseudodeltidium: Hinge furrows Character 46: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Posterior surface: Delthyrium: Pseudodeltidium: Hinge furrows 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. After Bassett et al. (19) character 18, “Hinge furrows on lateral sides of pseudodeltidium”. Acanthotretella spinosa, Askepasma toddense, Clupeafumosus socialis, Dailyatia, Eccentrotheca, Glyptoria, Haplophrentis carinatus, Heliomedusa orienta, Lingula, Lingulellotreta malongensis, Lingulosacculus, Micrina, Micromitra, Mummpikia nuda, Novocrania, Orthis, Paterimitra, Pedunculotheca diania, Pelagodiscus atlanticus, Phoronis, Terebratulina: Absent due to inapplicability of neomorphic character. Salanygolina: The presence of this feature is impossible to determine based on the available material. [47] Umbonal perforation Character 47: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Umbonal perforation 0: Umbo imperforate (or ventral valve absent) 1: Umbonal perforation Neomorphic character. Certain taxa, particularly those with a colleplax, exhibit a perforation at the umbo of the ventral valve. This opening is sometimes associated with a pedicle sheath, which emerges from the umbo of the ventral valve without any indication of a relationship with the hinge. In contrast, the pedicle of acrotretids and similar brachiopods is situated on the larval hinge line, but is later surrounded by the posterolateral regions of the growing shell to become separated from the hinge line, and encapsulated in a position close to (or with resorption of the brephic shell, at) the umbo (33). In some cases, an internal pedicle tube attests to this origin – potentially corresponding to the pedicle groove of lingulids. As such, the pedicle foramen of acrotretids and allies is not originally situated at the umbo; it is instead understood to represent a basally sealed delthyrium. Clupeafumosus socialis: The presumed pedicle foramen reported by Topper et al. (24) is at the ventral valve umbo. No evidence of an internal pedicle tube is present, but we follow Popov (33) in inferring the encapsulation of the pedicle foramen. Dailyatia: The B and C sclerites of Dailyatia bear small umbonal perforations (4), but these are not considered to be homologous with the ventral valve, so this character is coded as inapplicable – though the possibility that the perforations are equivalent is intriguing. A1 sclerites typically have a pair of perforations, which are conceivably equivalent to the setal tubes of Micrina (61). The A1 sclerite of D. bacata has a structure that is arguably similar to the ‘colleplax’ of Paterimitra. But the homology of any of these structures to the umbonal aperture of brachiopods is difficult to establish. Eccentrotheca: The sclerites of Eccentrotheca form a ring that surrounds the inferred attachment structure; the attachment structure does not emerge from an aperture within an individual sclerite. Thus no feature in Eccentrotheca is judged to be potentially homologous with the apical perforation in bivalved brachiopods. Heliomedusa orienta: There is “compelling evidence to demonstrate that the putative pedicle illustrated by Chen et al. (45) in fact is the mold of a three-dimensionally preserved visceral cavity.” – (47). Lingulosacculus: The apical termination of the fossil is unknown. Mickwitzia muralensis: The umbo itself is imperforate (25). Paterimitra: The presumed pedicle foramen is an opening between the S1 and S2 sclerites, neither of which are perforated (15). Siphonobolus priscus: Prominent subcircular perforation at umbo associated with an internal pedicle tube (41), thus presumed to share an origin with the acrotretid pedicle foramen. Tomteluva perturbata: Streng et al. (23) observe “an internal tubular structure probably representing the ventral end of the canal within the posterior wall of the pedicle tube”, but do not consider this tomteluvid dube to be homologous with the pedicle tube of acrotretids and their ilk, stating (p. 274) that it appears to be unique within Brachiopoda. [48] Umbonal perforation: Shape Character 48: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Umbonal perforation: Shape 1: Circular (or subcircular) 2: Rhombic to oval Transformational character. Acanthotretella spinosa: Too small to observe given quality of preservation (34). Alisina: Seemingly circular (62). Antigonambonites planus: Based on p.92, fig.4B. Clupeafumosus socialis: Taller than wide in some cases, but very nearly circular in others; see Topper et al. (24). Coolinia pecten: Bassett and Popov write “a dominant feature of the ventral umbo is a sub-oval perforation about 270 µm long and 250 µm wide”: the width and height of this structure are almost identical, and we score it as (sub) circular. Heliomedusa orienta: Rhombic to oval – seen as evidence for a discinid affinity (45). Kutorgina chengjiangensis: The exact size and shape of the apical perforation is obscured by the emerging pedicle. Nisusia sulcata: “close to circular” (27). Salanygolina: Essentially circular (40). [49] Colleplax, cicatrix or pedicle sheath Character 49: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Colleplax, cicatrix or pedicle sheath 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. In certain taxa, the umbo of the ventral valve bears a colleplax, cicatrix or pedicle sheath; Bassett et al. (63) consider these structures as homologous. Botsfordia: Following (16), appendix 2. Clupeafumosus socialis: Not reported by Topper et al. (24). Craniops: Paracraniops is “externally similar to Craniops, but lacking cicatrix” – indicating that Craniops bears a cicatrix (17). Also coded as present in their table 15. Heliomedusa orienta: A cicatrix was reconstructed by (64) (figs 6b, 7), but has not been reported by later authors; possibly, as with the ‘pedicle foramen’ of Chen et al. (45), this structure represents internal organs rather than a cicatrix proper (47); as such it has been recorded as ambiguous. Kutorgina chengjiangensis: The umbonal region of kutorginides “clearly lacks a pedicle sheath” (60). Lingulellotreta malongensis: The pedicle is identified as such (rather than a pedicle sheath) by the internal pedicle tube. Longtancunella chengjiangensis: A ring-like structure surrounding the pedicle is interpreted as a colleplax (20), though the authors make no comparison with the pedicle capsule exhibited by extant terebratulids (27). Micrina: Absent in Micrina (61). Pedunculotheca diania: The flat apical termination of juvenile individuals possibly functioned as colleplax for attachment, but may simply represent the brephic shell; we treat it as ambiguous to reflect this potential homology. Siphonobolus priscus: Coded as present in view of the attachment scar, which has been considered homologous with the “adult colleplax and foramen with attachment pad” in Salanygolina (41). Tomteluva perturbata: The internal canal associated with the pedicle is unique to the tomteluvids, and has an uncertain identity (23). It could conceivably correspond to an internalized pedicle sheath or an equivalent structure, so this feature is coded as ambiguous here. Ussunia: Following table 15 in (17). Yuganotheca elegans: The median collar or conical tube is conceivably homologous with the pedicle sheath. [50] Median septum Character 50: Sclerites: Ventral valve: Median septum 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Chen et al. (45) observe a median septum in what they interpret as the ventral valve of Heliomedusa, and the ventral valve of Discinisca, which they propose points to a close relationship. Acanthotretella spinosa: Carbonaceous preservation confounds the identification of internal shell structures; it is possible that this feature is present, but not observable in the Burgess Shale material. Botsfordia: Following (16), appendix 2. Clupeafumosus socialis: A short medial ridge (septum) is present in the ventral valve (24). Eoobolus: Prominent median septum (36). Gasconsia: Evident in moulds of ventral valve; see Watkins (65). Glyptoria: Neither evident nor reported in Williams et al. (17). Haplophrentis carinatus: The carina of H. carinatus is an angular elevation of the ventral valve surface, rather than a septum growing inward on the interior of shell. Heliomedusa orienta: Reported on ‘ventral’ valve by Chen et al. (45); we consider the ‘ventral’ valve to be the dorsal valve. Lingulellotreta malongensis: Medial septum visible in ventral valve in Williams et al. (17), fig. 34.1c. Micromitra: Ventral ridge characteristic of Micromitra (66). Mummpikia nuda: “Some specimens also reveal that the vault had a slight median septum, which is now visible as a notch or a groove dividing the right from the left part” – (26). Novocrania: Valve thin and often unmineralized. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Described as present in Discinisca by (45); assumed present also in Pelagodiscus. Siphonobolus priscus: Present; see (41), fig. 5J. Ussunia: Following char. 42 in table 15 in (17). 3.5 Sclerites: Ornament [51] Concentric ornament Character 51: Sclerites: Ornament: Concentric ornament 0: Smooth, or growth lines only 1: Concentric ornament present Neomorphic character. After character 11 in Williams et al. (16). Askepasma toddense, Glyptoria, Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Micromitra, Salanygolina: Following appendix 2 in Williams et al. (16). Botsfordia: Following (16), appendix 2. Pustules are arranged along concentric growth lines (53), so are not treated as a distinct ornamentation. Eccentrotheca: More or less concentric ridges occur on Eccentrotheca sclerites (67). Haplophrentis carinatus: A series of regularly spaced concentric ridges adorn both valves (14); these are more pronounced than mere growth lines. Heliomedusa orienta: The ornament on shell exterior is described as concentric fila (45), and also scored as it in Williams et al. (17). Mickwitzia muralensis: Symmetric fila. Novocrania: Irregular ridges externally (17). Pedunculotheca diania: A series of regularly spaced concentric ridges adorn the ventral valve; comparatively less regular lines ornament the operculum. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Only growth lines evident (17). Terebratulina: Single ridge evident in Williams et al. (32) fig. 1425.1a interpreted as interruption ot growth rather than inherent feature, so coded as absent (i.e. smooth). [52] Concentric ornament: Symmetry Character 52: Sclerites: Ornament: Concentric ornament: Symmetry 0: Symmetric fila 1: Asymmetric fila, with outer faces Neomorphic character. After character 11 in Williams et al. (16). Alisina: Seemingly asymmetric (17, 62). Askepasma toddense, Glyptoria, Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Micromitra, Salanygolina: Following appendix 2 in Williams et al. (16). Dailyatia: Clear asymmetry (4). Eccentrotheca: Ornament, such as it is, is asymmetric, with prominent outer faces (67). Heliomedusa orienta: See fig. 1715 in Williams et al. (22). Mickwitzia muralensis: Symmetric fila (25). Micrina: No obvious asymmetry, even if not obviously symmetric either (21). Coded as ambiguous. Novocrania: Clear outer faces (17). [53] Radial ornament Character 53: Sclerites: Ornament: Radial ornament 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Ridges radiating from umbo, i.e. ribs. Askepasma toddense: “Ornament of irregularly developed, concentric growth lamellae; microornament of irregularly arranged, polygonal pits” – (17), p153; figs on p.155. Botsfordia: Following (16), Appendix 2. Eoobolus: Very faint costellae in some specimens but coded absent. Gasconsia: “Ornament of indistinct low radial ribs” – Williams et al. (17). Glyptoria: “Coarsely costate” – Williams et al. (17). Heliomedusa orienta: See fig. 1715 in Williams et al. (22). Siphonobolus priscus: “Indistinct radial ribs accentuated by radial rows of tubercles” – (41). Ussunia: Unornamented. [54] Shell-penetrating spines Character 54: Sclerites: Ornament: Shell-penetrating spines 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Mineralized or partly mineralized spines are observed in Heliomedusa and Acanthotretella. Glyptoria: Neither evident nor reported in Williams et al. (17). Heliomedusa orienta: The ‘spines’ reported by Chen et al. (45) are pyritized spinelike setae – see pp. 2580–2590 in Williams et al. (22). Nisusia sulcata: Bears numerous small, hollow spines (17). 3.6 Sclerites: Composition [55] Mineralogy Character 55: Sclerites: Composition: Mineralogy 1: Organic (non-mineralized) 2: Phosphatic 3: Calcitic 4: Aragonitic Transformational character. Acanthotretella spinosa: Holmer &amp; Caron (34) note the absence of brittle breakage, interpreted as indicating the absence of a material mineralized component to the shells. The preservation is strikingly different from that of other Burgess Shale brachiopods, ruling out a primarily calcitic or phosphatic composition. The two-dimensional nature of the preservation also differs from that of co-occurring aragonitic taxa (34), indicating that any mineralization was minor at best. Holmer &amp; Caron (34) suggest that it is more likely that a (minor) mineral component was present than that it was not, though without providing an uncontestable rationale. To be as conservative as possible, we therefore code this taxon as ambiguous. Clupeafumosus socialis: Phosphatic – hence the conventional placement within Linguliformea. Craniops: Shell calcitic. Eoobolus: “the original shell of Eoobolus contained small calcareous grains that were incorporated into organic-rich layers alongside apatite” (68). Gasconsia: Confirmed in Trimerella by (69). Heliomedusa orienta: “Shell originally organophosphatic, but may generally have been poorly mineralized” – (22) – cf. ibid, p. 2889, “These strong similarities to discinoids in soft-part anatomy imply that the Heliomedusa shell was chitinous or chitinophosphatic, not calcareous.” Lingulellotreta malongensis: Coded as phosphatic by Zhang et al. (46), but with no explanation. Cracks within shells of Chengjiang specimens (70) demonstrate that the shells were originally mineralized, but not the identity of the original biomineral. This said, phosphatized material from Kazakhstan (38) is attributed to the same species; presuming this phosphate to be original and the material to be conspecific, L. malongensis is coded as having phosphatic shells. Lingulosacculus: The absence of relief in Lingulosacculus rules out a phosphatic or calcitic composition, but co-occurring (and presumably aragonitic) hyolithids are preserved in the same fashion. Its constitution was thus either organic or aragonitic (52). Longtancunella chengjiangensis: “The original composition of the shell cannot be determined with certainty”, though it was “most probably entirely soft and organic” – (20). Mickwitzia muralensis: Calcite and silica deemed diagenetic by Balthasar (25). Mummpikia nuda: Identified as calcareous by preservational criteria, and description “primary calcitic shells of M. nuda” (26). Novocrania: Ventral valve uncalcified in extant forms or sometimes thin (17), but coded as calcitic as calcite-mineralizing pathways are present. Salanygolina: Original mineralogy unknown, but known to be mineralised and anticipated to be phosphatic (40). [56] Cuticle or organic matrix Character 56: Sclerites: Composition: Cuticle or organic matrix 1: GAGs, chitin and collagen 2: Glycoprotein Transformational character. Williams et al. (42) identify glycoprotein-based organic scaffolds as distinct from those comprising glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), chitin and collagen. This character can only be scored for extant taxa. Lingula: Coded as GAGs, chitin and collagen in lingulids by Williams et al. (42). Novocrania: Coded as glycoprotein for craniids by Williams et al. (42). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Coded as GAGs, chitin and collagen in discinids by Williams et al. (42). Phoronis: “The presence of sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the chitinous cuticle of Phoronis (71) would suggest a link with linguliforms, as GAGs are unknown in rhynchonelliform shells (Fig. 1891, 1896)” – (22), p. 2830. Siphonobolus priscus: Lenticular chambers in siphonotretid shells interpreted as degraded GAG residue (72). Terebratulina: Coded as glycoprotein for terebratulids by Williams et al. (42). [57] Incorporation of sedimentary particles Character 57: Sclerites: Composition: Incorporation of sedimentary particles 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Phoronids and Yuganotheca aggulutinate particles into their sclerites. [58] Periostracum: Flexibility Character 58: Sclerites: Composition: Periostracum: Flexibility 1: Flexible 2: Inflexible Transformational character. Following character 9 in Williams et al. (16); see their p228–230 for a discussion of how this might be inferred from fossil material. Askepasma toddense, Glyptoria, Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Micromitra: Following appendix 2 in Williams et al. (16). Botsfordia, Eoobolus: Coded as flexible in (16), Appendix 2. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Flexible (16). Salanygolina: Coded as uncertain in appendix 2 in Williams et al. (16). [59] Microstructure: Layers Character 59: Sclerites: Composition: Microstructure: Layers 1: Single microstructural layer 2: Two microstructurally differentiated layers 3: Inner and outer laminae enclosing medial void 4: Three microstrurally differentiated layers Transformational character. Hyolith conchs comprise two mineralized layers of fibrous bundles. Bundles are measure 5–15 µm across; their constituent fibres are each 0.1–1.0 µm wide. In the inner layer, the fibres are transverse; in the outer layer, the bundles are inclined towards the umbo, becoming longitudinal on the outermost margin. Obolellids comprise a single laminated mineralogical layer (26). Shell-penetrating canals are not considered as contributing to the mineralogical microstructure and are coded separately. Coded as non-additive as there is no clear necessity to pass through the brachiopod-like construction: the three layers could arise by the addition of a void to a single pre-existing layer, for example. Inapplicable in taxa with a non-mineralized shell. Botsfordia: “Composed of a thin primary layer and a laminate secondary shell exhibiting baculate shell structure” – Skovsted &amp; Holmer (53), with reference to (54). Clupeafumosus socialis: General acrotretid structure taken from Zhang et al. (73). Eoobolus: “Eoobolus shells exhibit the general characteristics of modern linguliform shells, i.e. they were composed of alternating sets of organic and apatite-rich layers that were separated by thin sheets of recalcitrant organic layers.” – (68). Haplophrentis carinatus: Assumed to be equivalent to the hyoliths described by Kouchinsky (74). Mickwitzia muralensis: “the shell structure of Mickwitzia […] is closely similar to the columnar shell of linguliform acrotretoid brachiopods as well as to the linguloid Lingulellotreta, in that it has slender columns in the laminar succession” – (22). Micrina: Identical to Mickwitzia and more derived linguliforms (61). Siphonobolus priscus: “Orthodoxly secreted primary and secondary layers” – (72). [60] Microstructure: Crystal format Character 60: Sclerites: Composition: Microstructure: Crystal format 1: Laminated 2: Fibrous bundles 3: Polygonal columns Transformational character. Hyolith conchs comprise two mineralized layers of fibrous bundles. Bundles measure 5–15 μm across; their constituent fibres are each 0.1–1.0 µm wide. In the inner layer, the fibres are transverse; in the outer layer, the bundles are inclined towards the umbo, becoming longitudinal on the outermost margin. Obolellids comprise a single laminated mineralogical layer (26). Shell-penetrating canals are not considered as contributing to the mineralogical microstructure and are coded separately. The pervasive (not just superficial) polygonal structures in Paterimitra are distinct, and characterize Askepasma, Salanygolina, Eccentrotheca and Paterimitra (48) Williams et al. (17) identify cross-bladed laminae as diagnostic of Strophomenata, with the exception of some older groups that contain fibres or laminar laths. Antigonambonites planus: Shell structure of this taxon is laminated, rather than fibrous as previously considered. Botsfordia: “Composed of a thin primary layer and a laminate secondary shell exhibiting baculate shell structure” – Skovsted &amp; Holmer (53), with reference to (54). Craniops: “with calcitic or possibly aragonitic inarticulated shells with laminar (tabular) secondary layers” (17). Haplophrentis carinatus: Inferred from other hyolithids (75). Pedunculotheca diania: Assumed to be fibrous by analogy with the allothecomorph orthothecid described by Kouchinsky (74). Siphonobolus priscus: Prominent laminations; see Williams et al. (72). [61] Microstructure: Punctae Character 61: Sclerites: Composition: Microstructure: Punctae 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Punctae are 10–20 µm wide canals created by multicellular extensions of the outer epithelium. They penetrate the full depth of the shell. Balthasar (26) writes: “Vertical shell penetrating structures, such as punctae, pseudopunctae, extropunctae and canals, are common in many groups of brachiopods and are distinguished based on their geometry and size (29). Punctae are 10–20 µm wide and represent multicellular extensions of the outer epithelium (76). Pseudopunctae and extropunctae are similar in diameter but, instead of canals, are vertical stacks of conical deflections of individual shell layers (77). None of these three types of vertical shell structure, all of which are confined to calcitic-shelled brachiopods, compares with the much smaller canals (&lt; 1 µm in diameter) of M. nuda. The only type of vertical structure that fits the size and nature of the canals of the Mural obolellids are the canals of linguliform brachiopods, which range in width from 180 to 740 nm and are occupied by proteinaceous strands in extant taxa (29, 78, 79). In contrast to obolellid canals, however, linguliform canals are not known to penetrate the entire shell but terminate in organic-rich layers (29). Based on these considerations it would, therefore, be misleading to call obolellid shells punctate (they are as much”punctate&quot; as acrotretids or other linguliforms); rather their shell structure should be called canaliculate (29).&quot; Craniops: “impunctate”. Haplophrentis carinatus: The tubules within the centre of the bundles of hyolith shells (74) are c. 10 µm wide, making them an order of magnitude larger than the canals that characterize lingulid valves, and a similar scale to punctae. This said, they have only been reported in a putative allathecid, so the presence of equivalent structures in hyolithids has never been demonstrated. Heliomedusa orienta: ‘Identical’ to those in Mickwitzia – see (22). Mickwitzia muralensis: Coded as present to reflect that the chambers contained setae; following Carlson in (22), the punctae may or may not be homologous as punctae, but are likely homologous as shell perforations; both these perforations and those of Micrina were associated with setae, even if their equivalence bay be with juvenile vs adult setal structures in modern brachiopods (25). Mummpikia nuda: “Vertical shell penetrating structures, such as punctae, pseudopunctae, extropunctae and canals, are common in many groups of brachiopods and are distinguished based on their geometry and size (29). Punctae are 10–20 µm wide and represent multicellular extensions of the outer epithelium (76). […] None of these three types of vertical shell structure, all of which are confined to calcitic-shelled brachiopods, compares with the much smaller canals (&lt; 1 µm in diameter) of M. nuda. The only type of vertical structure that fits the size and nature of the canals of the Mural obolellids are the canals of linguliform brachiopods, which range in width from 180 to 740 nm and are occupied by proteinaceous strands in extant taxa (29, 78).” – (26). Siphonobolus priscus: The ‘canals’ through the shell have a diameter of c. 20 µm (72), falling within the definition of punctae used herein. Terebratulina: Endopunctae are relatively large canals, diameter vary greatly from 5–20 m. [62] Microstructure: Canals Character 62: Sclerites: Composition: Microstructure: Canals 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. A caniculate microstructure occurs in lingulids; canals are narrower (&lt; 1 µm) than punctae, may branch, and do not fully penetrate the shell, terminating just within the boundaries of a microstructural layer. See (29), p303ff, and (26), p273, for discussion. Tubules described in hyoliths by Kouchinsky (74) measure around 10 µm in diameter, making them an order of magnitude wider than lingulid canals. This said, Balthasar (26) considers the tubules within the columnar shell microstructure of Mickwitzia cf. occidens (54), acrotretides (80) and lingulellotretids (81) as equivalent to lingulid canals. Micrina exhibits both punctae and canals (82), challenging Carlson’s contention (22) that the structures are potentially homologous as shell perforations. Botsfordia: Not evident in section presented by Skovsted &amp; Holmer (54). Clupeafumosus socialis: Acrotretid laminae bear characteristic columns (73). Balthasar (26) considers these columns as homologous with tubules within the columnar shell microstructure Mummpikia, Mickwitzia and lingulellotretids. Haplophrentis carinatus: Zhang et al. (83) have reported um-scale canals, replicated in phosphate, within the shell of the hyolithid Paramicrocornus; as shell microstructure is not preserved in Haplophrentis, this latter taxon is taken as a model. Longtancunella chengjiangensis: Preservational resolution not sufficient to evaluate. Mickwitzia muralensis: Coded as present to reflect similarity of columnar microstructure remarked on by, among others, Balthasar (26); Williams et al. (22); Skovsted &amp; Holmer (54). Micrina: Acrotretid laminae bear characteristic columns (73); a similar fabric has been reported, and assumed homologous, in Micrina (84). A similar columnar shell microstructure also occurs in the closely related Mickwitzia (26). Siphonobolus priscus: The ‘canals’ through the shell have a diameter of c. 20 µm (72), falling within the definition of punctae (rather than canals) used herein. [63] Microstructure: Pseudopunctae Character 63: Sclerites: Composition: Microstructure: Pseudopunctae 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Pseudopunctae are not punctae, but deflections of shell laminae. They characterise Strophomenata in particular. Antigonambonites planus, Glyptoria, Nisusia sulcata: Scored absent in data matrix of Benedetto (28). Orthis: Scored absent (in Eoorthis) in data matrix of Benedetto (28). [64] Microstructure: External polygonal ornament Character 64: Sclerites: Composition: Microstructure: External polygonal ornament 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Regular polygonal compartments, around 10 µm in diameter, characterise Paterimitra. Walls between compartments have the cross-section of an anvil. An external polygonal structure (possible imprints of epithelial tissue) occurs in Dailyatia, but it is a surface pattern, which is different from the polygonal prisms in the body wall of other paterinid-like groups. Clupeafumosus socialis: The polygonal ornament reported in acrotretids by Zhang et al. (73) is on the internal surface of the shell. 3.7 Gametes [65] Egg size Character 65: Gametes: Egg size 1: Small: &lt; 100 um, little yolk 2: Large: &gt; 110 um, much yolk Transformational character. Following Carlson (85), character 7. This character is only possible to code in extant taxa. It is not considered independent of Carlson’s character 11, number of gametes released per spawning, as it is possible to produce more small eggs than large eggs – thus this latter character is not reproduced in the present study. The same goes for Carlson’s character 12, gamete dispersal mode; brooders will tend to brood large eggs. Lingula, Novocrania, Pelagodiscus atlanticus, Terebratulina: Following coding for class in Carlson (85) appendix 1, character 7. Phoronis: Phoronis has planktotrophic larvae. indicating a small egg size (86). Carlson (85) codes phoronids as polymorphic, as some members of the phylum have eggs of each size. Siphonobolus priscus: “the ventral brephic valve [was] 50 µm across, [which] is close to the known lower limit of the brachiopod egg size” – (41). [66] Site of maturation Character 66: Gametes: Site of maturation 0: Body cavity 1: Mantle canals Neomorphic character. After Carlson (85), character 9. Only possible to code in extant taxa. Mantle canals is considered the derived state, as it represents a migration from the body cavity, where gametes are produced. Lingula, Novocrania, Pelagodiscus atlanticus, Terebratulina: Following Hodgson &amp; Reunov (87). Phoronis: Following coding for class in Carlson (85) Appendix 1, character 9. 3.8 Gametes: Spermatozoa [67] Nucleus: Broad anterior invagination Character 67: Gametes: Spermatozoa: Nucleus: Broad anterior invagination 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Following discussion in (87). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Following Discinisca tenuis, described in Hodgson &amp; Reunov (87). Phoronis: Nucleus “almost round”: (88). Terebratulina: (87). [68] Acrosome: Shape Character 68: Gametes: Spermatozoa: Acrosome: Shape 1: Pear-shaped 2: Needle-shaped 3: Disc-shaped Transformational character. Lingula: Pear-shaped (89). Novocrania: Needle-shaped (90). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Pear-shaped (87). Phoronis: Needle-shaped (88). Terebratulina: Disc-shaped (in Kraussina) (87). [69] Acrosome: Differentiated internally Character 69: Gametes: Spermatozoa: Acrosome: Differentiated internally 0: No internal differentiation 1: Acrosome differentiated internally Neomorphic character. (87) describe the Discinisca acrosome as having “an electron-lucent centre and an electron-dense outer region”, and state that this trait is characteristic of inarticulate brachiopods. Lingula: Clear differentiation of marginal area (89). Novocrania: “Along the inner and outer margins there are periodically banded layers, and between them there is a less dense layer” – (90). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Following Discinisca tenuis, described in Hodgson &amp; Reunov (87). Phoronis: Acrosome-like structure; no internal division or surrounding membrane, with possibility that much of the acrosome is secondarily lost (88). Terebratulina: Following Hodgson &amp; Reunov (87). [70] Acrosome: Sub-acrosomal space Character 70: Gametes: Spermatozoa: Acrosome: Sub-acrosomal space 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Lingula: Filled with sub-acrosomal substance (89). Novocrania: Prominent (90). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Subacrosomal material (in Discinisca) but no subacrosomal space (87). Phoronis: The filament-like acrosome continues backwards as a tube-like structure (91). Terebratulina: No subacrosomal material, let alone a subacrosomal space (87). [71] Mid-piece Character 71: Gametes: Spermatozoa: Mid-piece 0: Single ring-shaped mitochondrion 1: Multiple mitochondria Neomorphic character. Following Hodgson &amp; Reunov (87). Lingula, Terebratulina: Following Hodgson &amp; Reunov (87). Novocrania: Four mitochondria (90). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Following Discinisca tenuis, described in Hodgson &amp; Reunov (87). Phoronis: The mitochondria fuse in the middle stage of spermiogenesis to become a pair of mitochondria (88). [72] Centrioles Character 72: Gametes: Spermatozoa: Centrioles 0: Orthogonal 1: Parallel Neomorphic character. Following (87). Lingula, Terebratulina: Following Hodgson &amp; Reunov (87). Novocrania: Two orthogonal centrioles (90). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Following Discinisca tenuis, described in Hodgson &amp; Reunov (87). Phoronis: Only one centriole in spermatzoon (88), but centrioles are perpendicularly oriented in spermatogonia (ibid., p. 2). 3.9 Brephic shell [73] Embryonic shell Character 73: Brephic shell: Embryonic shell 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. The embryonic shell or protegulum is secreted by the embryo immediately before hatching. Clupeafumosus socialis: Described by Topper et al. (24). Novocrania: Shell not secreted until after metamorphosis (93). [74] Morphology Character 74: Brephic shell: Morphology 1: Flat, disc-like (cf. Micrina) 2: Three prominent lobes forming a Y (cf. Paterimitra) 3: Spherical Transformational character. The brephic shell is the shell possessed by the young organism (56). Micrina resembles linguliforms (61): in both, the brephic mitral shell has one pair of setal sacs enclosed by lateral lobes, whereas the brephic ventral shell has two lateral setal tubes. Paterimitra and Salanygolina have “identical” ventral brephic shells (61), resembling the shape of a ship’s propeller. Haplophrentis is coded following typical hyoliths, which have a spherical brephic shell; Pedunculotheca’s, in contrast, is seemingly cap-shaped. Askepasma toddense: Renoid – see fig. 4B3 in (31). Clupeafumosus socialis: The flat larval shell of Clupeafumosus resembles that of Micrina in outline (24, 61). Coolinia pecten: See fig. 3 in (43). Craniops: The embryonic shell is more or less circular in outline – see (94), fig. 6A. Lingula: See fig. 159 in (29). Mickwitzia muralensis: Trifoliate appearance results from prominent attachment rudiment and bunching of setal sacs (36). Micromitra: Subtriangular – essentially round. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: See e.g. fig 169 in Williams et al. (29). [75] Embryonic shell extended in larvae Character 75: Brephic shell: Embryonic shell extended in larvae 1: Not extended; embryonic shell contiguous with adult shell 2: Extended into larval shell, separated from adult shell by prominent nick Transformational character. Many taxa add to their embryonic shell (the protegulum possessed by the embryo upon hatching) during the larval phase of their life cycle. The shell that exists at metamorphosis, marked by a halo or nick point, is variously termed the “first formed shell”, “metamorphic shell” or “larval shell” (43). Clupeafumosus socialis: Described by Topper et al. (24). Craniops: Prominent nick; see (94), fig. 6A. Eoobolus: Nick point indicated by arrows in fig. 1 of Balthasar (36). Pedunculotheca diania: The flattened region at the umbo of the ventral valve in smaller specimens conceivably represents an embryonic shell, though it may alternatively represent a cicatrix or colleplax-like structure. [76] Surface ornament Character 76: Brephic shell: Surface ornament 1: Smooth 2: Rounded pits 3: Polygonal impressions 4: Pustulose Transformational character. Pitting of the larval shell characterises acrotretids and their relatives. Pustules occur on Paterinidae. See Character 3 in Williams et al. (17) tables 5–6. Askepasma toddense: Indented with hexagonal pits (16). Eoobolus: Pitted (17). Lingula, Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Smooth, following family-level codings of (17), table 6. Micrina: Smooth (61). Micromitra: Pustolose in Paterinidae (17). Paterimitra: Polygonal texture present (61), as in the adult shell. Salanygolina: Smooth (40). [77] Larval attachment structure Character 77: Brephic shell: Larval attachment structure 0: Without evidence of pedicle 1: With evidence of pedicle Neomorphic character. Embryonic shells of Micrina and certain linguliforms exhibit a transversely folded posterior extension that speaks of the original presence of a pedicle in the embryo. This is independent of the presence of an adult pedicle, which may arise after metamorphosis. Clupeafumosus socialis: The larval shell embraces the pedicle foramen, suggesting a larval attachment. See fig. 4 of Topper et al. (24). Eoobolus: Lobe related to the attachment rudiment (36). Mickwitzia muralensis: Note the posterior lobe related to the attachment rudiment in fig. 2 of (36). Siphonobolus priscus: Interpreted as having planktotrophic (and thus non-attached) larvae (41). [78] Setulose Character 78: Brephic shell: Setulose 0: No evidence of setae in embryonic shell 1: Setae present Neomorphic character. The protegulum of Micrina is penetrated with canals that were originally associated with setae, a character that it has in common with linguliforms (61). Botsfordia: “One specimen shows fine capillae running laterally from the posterior tubercles on the dorsal valve (Pl. 3, fig. 5b). This is possibly the imprints of setae.” – (56). Clupeafumosus socialis: Setal bundles interpreted as present in acrotretids by Ushatinskaya (50). Lingulellotreta malongensis: Familial character: larval shell smooth (williams et al.,2000, p.72). Mickwitzia muralensis: Four setal sacs. 3.10 Brephic shell: Setal sacs [79] Character 79: Brephic shell: Setal sacs 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Setal sacs are recognizable as raised lumps on the juvenile shell (43). Micrina and linguliforms have setal sacs on their mitral/dorsal embryonic shell, whereas these are absent in Paterimitra (61). Botsfordia: A single pair of low tubercles are (56) located in the middle region of the dorsal and the ventral brephic valve; these are interpreted as a single pair of setal sacs, with the identity of the (dorsally unpaired) tubercles uncertain. Clupeafumosus socialis: Setal bundles interpreted as present in acrotretids by Ushatinskaya (50). Lingula: Lingulids’ larval setae are not arranged in bundles (85). Lingulellotreta malongensis: Familial character: larval shell smooth (williams et al.,2000, p.72). Novocrania, Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Three pairs (85). [80] Number Character 80: Brephic shell: Setal sacs: Number 1: One pair 2: Two pairs 3: Three pairs Transformational character. Two pairs on e.g. Coolina; one on e.g. Micrina. Botsfordia: “larval shell with one to three apical tubercles in ventral valve and two in dorsal valve” (17) – if these correspond to setal sacs, then we interpret this as equivalent to one pair. Clupeafumosus socialis: Two pairs identified in acrotretids by Ushatinskaya (50). Mickwitzia muralensis: See fig. 2 in (36). Novocrania, Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Three pairs (85). Siphonobolus priscus: Two pairs of setal sacs (41). 3.11 Setae [81] Present in adults Character 81: Setae: Present in adults 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Although preservation of setae (in adults) is exceptional, their presence can be inferred from shelly material (34). Acanthotretella spinosa: Note that the setae do not obviously emerge from tubes, leading Holmer and Caron to question their homology with the setae of other taxa (Heliomedusa, Mickwitzia). Both valves of Acanthotretella were covered by long spine-like and shell penetrating setae. The setae of A. decaius are usually preserved along anterior and anterolateral margins (95). Clupeafumosus socialis: Setal bundles interpreted as present in acrotretids by Ushatinskaya (50). Novocrania: “Adult craniids are without setae (a feature shared with the thecideides, the shells of which are also cemented).” – (22). Siphonobolus priscus: Phosphatised setae emerge from hollow spines (41). [82] Distribution Character 82: Setae: Distribution 1: Uniform 2: Only present at margins of shell Transformational character. Setae penetrate the valves of many brachiopods. In certain taxa, they are apparent only at the margins of the valves, in association with the commissure, being reduced or lost over the surface of the shell. Eccentrotheca: Skovsted et al. (67) assumed the setae may have been present along the margin of the adapical opening, but there is no fossil evidence. Heliomedusa orienta: Throughout the shell – see (22) – causing the pustulose appearance remarked upon by (45). 3.12 Pedicle [83] Character 83: Pedicle 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. The brachiopod pedicle is a fleshy protuberance that emerges from the posterior part of the body wall – as denoted in fossil taxa by its occurrence between the dorsal and ventral valves. It is important to distinguish the pedicle from the “pedicle sheath”, a tubular extension of the umbo that grows by accretion from an isolated portion of the ventral mantle. For discussion see (60) and (43). Acanthotretella spinosa: The attachment structure of Acanthotretella originates at the margin of the dorsal and ventral valves; although it emerges from the umbo of the ventral valve, the presence of an internal pedicle tube betrays its identity as a pedicle, rather than a pedicle sheath. The pedicle of Acanthotretella emerges from a short extension of the umbo of the ventral valve. This extension is contiguous with the valve and presumably grew by accretion; its position and continuity with the valve suggest its interpretation as a pedicle sheath that is superseded as an attachment structure. On the other hand, its continuity with the internal pedicle tube suggests that is may represent an independent organ. Botsfordia: Pedicle foramen was not necessarily occupied by a pedicle (though it presumably was). Clupeafumosus socialis: A pedicle was presumably present, but only the foramen is preserved. Craniops: Attached apically by cementation. Heliomedusa orienta: “It seems unlikely that H. orienta possessed a pedicle that attached it to the soft seafloor, like most other Chengjiang brachiopods.” … “The putative pedicle illustrated by Chen et al. (45) in fact is the mold of a three-dimensionally preserved visceral cavity” – (47). Lingulosacculus: The absence of a pedicle is inferred from the absence of an internal pedicle tube, and the absence of a pedicle at the hinge. Mickwitzia muralensis: An attachment structure is inferred based on the presence of an opening (25); this is assumed to have been homologous with the brachiopod pedicle. Nisusia sulcata: Has a pedicle, rather than a pedicle sheath as in Kutorgina (27, 60). Paterimitra: “Paterimitra is interpreted to have attached to hard substrates via a pedicle that emerged through the small posterior opening” – (15). Siphonobolus priscus: Presumed present, based on ventral foramen with colleplax. [84] Constitution Character 84: Pedicle: Constitution 1: Massive or uniform 2: Densely stacked tabular discs Transformational character. The pedicle of certain chengjiang rhynchonelliforms comprises “densely stacked, three dimensionally preserved, tabular discs” (27). This contrasts with the uniform (‘massive’) pedicles of living taxa. Terebratulina: Extant rhynconellid pedicles are massive, consisting of a thick outer chitinous cuticle, a pedicle epithelium, and a core composed of collagen fibres and cartilage-like connective tissue (27). [85] Biomineralization Character 85: Pedicle: Biomineralization 1: Absent 2: Present Transformational character. The pedicle of strophomenates such as Antigonambonites is biomineralized (27). [86] Bulb Character 86: Pedicle: Bulb 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. A bulb is an expanded region of the distal pedicle, often embedded into the sediment to improve anchorage. Acanthotretella spinosa: Holmer and Caron (34) interpret the presence of a bulb as tentative; we score it as ambiguous. [87] Distal rootlets Character 87: Pedicle: Distal rootlets 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Observed in Pedunculotheca and Bethia (96). [88] Tapering Character 88: Pedicle: Tapering 1: Uniform thickness 2: Tapering Transformational character. Holmer et al. (60) remark that the tapering aspect of the Nisusia pedicle recalls that of certain Chengjiang taxa (Alisina, Longtancunella) whilst distinguishing it from many other taxa (Eichwaldia, Bethia) in which the pedicle is a constant thickness. Antigonambonites planus: Tapered pedicle sheath with holdfast. Pedunculotheca diania: The pedicle thickness does not obviously change between the apex of the shell and the holdfast. [89] Coelomic region Character 89: Pedicle: Coelomic region 1: Absent 2: Present Transformational character. Certain brachiopods, such as Acanthotretella, exhibit a coelomic cavity within the pedicle or pedicle sheath. Treated as transformational as it is not clear that either state is necessarily ancestral. Nisusia sulcata: A coleomic canal is inferred based on the ease with which the pedicle is deformed (27), but its presence is not known for certain so is coded ambiguous. [90] Surface ornament Character 90: Pedicle: Surface ornament 1: Smooth 2: Irregular wrinkles 3: Regular annulations Transformational character. Annulations are regular rings that surround the pedicle, and are distinguished from wrinkles, which are irregular in magnitude and spacing, and may branch or fail to entirely encircle the pedicle. Acanthotretella spinosa: “The pedicle surface is ornamented with pronounced annulated rings, disposed at intervals of about 0.2 mm”. Alisina: “It appears that the pedicle lacks a coelomic space and is distinctly annulated, with densely stacked tabular bodies” – (62). Antigonambonites planus: “The emerging pedicle has a consistent shape in all the available specimens and is strongly annulated and distally tapering” – (27). Kutorgina chengjiangensis: “Pronounced concentric annular discs disposed at intervals of 0.6&lt;96&gt;1.0 mm”. Lingulellotreta malongensis: Regularly annotated (97). Longtancunella chengjiangensis: “The preserved pedicle has condensed annulations” – (20). Nisusia sulcata: The “strong annulations” vary significantly in transverse thickness (27), so it is not clear whether these represent true annulations or wrinkles. Yuganotheca elegans: Annulations present in median collar. [91] Nerve impression Character 91: Pedicle: Nerve impression 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. In certain taxa the impression of the pedicle nerve is evident in the shell. See character 28 in Williams et al. (16) appendix 1. Care must be taken not to code an impression as absent when the preservational quality is insufficient to safely infer a genuine absence. Treated as neomorphic as the presence of an innervation is considered a derived state. Alisina: Not described by (17). Askepasma toddense, Glyptoria, Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Micromitra, Salanygolina: Following (16), appendix 2. Botsfordia: Documented by (49). Clupeafumosus socialis: Coded as absent in Acrotretidae (17). Lingula: Present in many lingulids (17), and coded as present in Lingulidae (17). Lingulellotreta malongensis: Coded as present in Lingulellotretidae (17). Mummpikia nuda: Balthasar (26) identifies a canal as a probable impression of a pedicle nerve. Nisusia sulcata, Orthis: Not reported in (17). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Coded as present in Discinidae (17). Siphonobolus priscus: Coded as absent in Siphonotretidae (17). 3.13 Mantle canals [92] Morphology Character 92: Mantle canals: Morphology 1: Pinnate (=lemniscate) 2: Bifurcate 3: Baculate 4: Saccate Transformational character. The morphology of dorsal and ventral canals is identical in all included taxa, so is assumed not to be independent – hence the use of a single character (17). For a description of terms see Williams et al. (29). Pinnate = “rapidly branch into a number of subequal, radially disposed canals” Bifurcate = “vascula lateralia in both valves divide immediately after leaving the body cavity” Baculate = “extend forward without any major dichotomy or bifurcation” (29) Saccate = “pouchlike sinuses lying wholly posterior to the arcuate vascula media” (ibid., p412). Acanthotretella spinosa: Following Table 6, for Siphonotretidae, in Williams et al. (17). Alisina, Nisusia sulcata: Following Table 15 in Williams et al. (17). Antigonambonites planus: Not reported in Treatise (17). Askepasma toddense: Described as pinnate (at least in ventral valve) by Williams et al. (16). Botsfordia, Eoobolus: Following (16), appendix 2, and Williams et al. (17), table 8. Clupeafumosus socialis: Following Table 8 (for Acrotreta) in Williams et al. (17), and the general pinnate condition for acrotretoids stated in Williams et al. (29), p. 420. Coolinia pecten: Not reported in (17). Craniops: Not reported from fossil material. Gasconsia: Williams et al. (17) appear to use Palaeotrimerella (29) as a model for Gasconsia, which pre-supposes a close relationship. We are not aware of any report of mantle canals from Gasconsia itself. Glyptoria: Following appendix 2 (char. 21) in Williams et al. (16). Heliomedusa orienta: Described as pinnate by Jin &amp; Wang (64). Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Novocrania: Following table 15 in Williams et al. (17) (for Neocrania). Lingula, Lingulellotreta malongensis: Following table 6 in Williams et al. (17). Lingulosacculus: Baculate vascula media – Balthasar &amp; Butterfield (52). Longtancunella chengjiangensis: Reported by Zhang et al. (51) though the interpretation is tentative. Micromitra: Described as saccate by Williams et al. (16). Mummpikia nuda: “Poorly resolved” – (26). Orthis: Sacculate (sometimes digitate in dorsal valve) (17). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Following table 6, for Discinidae, in Williams et al. (17). Salanygolina: Coded uncertain in appendix 2 in Williams et al. (16). Terebratulina: “In modern terebratulides, the vascula media are subordinate to the lemniscate or pinnate vascula genitalia” – (29). Tomteluva perturbata: Preservation not adequate to evaluate (23). [93] vascula lateralia Character 93: Mantle canals: vascula lateralia 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. We treat the vascula lateralia as equivalent to the vascula genitalia of articulated brachiopods, allowing phylogenetic analysis to test their proposed homology. Williams et al. (29) write: “The mantle canal system of most of the organophosphate-shelled species consists of a single pair of main trunks in the ventral mantle (vascula lateralia) and two pairs in the dorsal mantle, one pair (vascula lateralia) occupying a similar position to the single pair in the ventral mantle and a second pair projecting from the body cavity near the midline of the valve. This latter pair may be termed the vascula media, but whether they are strictly homologous with the vascula media of articulated brachiopods is a matter of opinion. It is also impossible to assert that the vascula lateralia are the homologues of the vascula myaria or genitalia of articulated species, although they are likely to be so as they arise in a comparable position.” “In inarticulated brachiopods, two main mantle canals (vascula lateralia) emerge from the main body cavity through muscular valves and bifurcate distally to produce an increasingly dense array of blindly ending branches near the periphery of the mantle (fig. 71.1–71.2).” Acanthotretella spinosa: Following table 8 (which records presence in Siphonotreta) in Williams et al. (17). Alisina, Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Nisusia sulcata: Following table 15 in Williams et al. (17). Askepasma toddense, Micromitra: “Laurie (98) has shown that arcuate vascula media were present in the mantles of both valves as were pouchlike vascula genitalia, especially in the ventral valve” – (29). Botsfordia: Following Popov (33). Clupeafumosus socialis: Presence indicated in Table 8 (for Acrotreta) in Williams et al. (17). Gasconsia: Williams et al. (17) appear to use Palaeotrimerella (29) as a model for Gasconsia, which pre-supposes a close relationship. We are not aware of any report of mantle canals from Gasconsia itself. Heliomedusa orienta: Present: Williams et al. (17); Jin &amp; Wang (64). Lingulellotreta malongensis: Present (17). Longtancunella chengjiangensis: Presence is possible but requires interpretation that is not unambiguous: “In the dorsal valve, there can be seen two baculate grooves that arise from the anterior body wall at an antero-lateral position. These two grooves (Figs 4H, 5D) could be taken to represent the vascula lateralia” – (51). Novocrania: Following table 15 in Williams et al. (17) (for Neocrania), who write that “Holocene craniides have only a single pair of main trunks in both valves, corresponding to the vascula lateralia”. Williams et al. (22) reiterate this position (p. 2875), at least for the ventral valve. Orthis, Terebratulina: = vascula genitalia. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Following Lochkothele (Discinidae), Fig. 43.4a in Williams et al. (17). Siphonobolus priscus: Noted in Siphonobolus by Williams et al. (17), with reference to Havlicek (99). Tomteluva perturbata: Preservation not adequate to evaluate (23). Yuganotheca elegans: Based on the figures and sketches in (46) (and supplementary material), the mantle canals are interpreted as lateral, with no clear vascula media present. [94] vascula media Character 94: Mantle canals: vascula media 0: Absent 1: Present (in dorsal valve) Neomorphic character. Williams et al. (29) note that in addition to the vascula lateralia, “Discinisca has two additional mantle canals emanating from the body cavity into the dorsal mantle (vascula media).” These structures are only evident in the dorsal valve for the included taxa, so only a single character is necessary. Acanthotretella spinosa: Following table 6 (for Siphonotretidae) in Williams et al. (17). Alisina, Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Nisusia sulcata: Following table 15 in Williams et al. (17). Askepasma toddense: Following table 6 (for Paterinidae) in Williams et al. (17). Botsfordia: Following Popov (33). Clupeafumosus socialis: Following Hadrotreta schematic in Williams et al. (17). Eoobolus: Fig. 5 in (36). Gasconsia: Williams et al. (17) appear to use Palaeotrimerella (29) as a model for Gasconsia, which pre-supposes a close relationship. We are not aware of any report of mantle canals from Gasconsia itself. Glyptoria: Present and divergent (17). Heliomedusa orienta: Present: Williams et al. (17) p162, Jin &amp; Wang (64). Lingula, Lingulellotreta malongensis: Following table 6 in Williams et al. (17). Longtancunella chengjiangensis: Reported by Zhang et al. (51) though the interpretation is tentative. Micromitra: Reported by Williams et al. (16). Novocrania: Williams et al. (17) write “Holocene craniides have only a single pair of main trunks in both valves, corresponding to the vascula lateralia” – an observation reflected in their table 15 (for Neocrania). But in contrast, (22), p. 2875, identify the dorsal valve’s canals as a vascula media in living cranidds (though both are lateralia in Ordoviian craniides). This character is therefore coded as ambiguous. Orthis: From idealised morphology in Williams et al. (17). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Following table 6 (for Discinidae) in Williams et al. (17). Siphonobolus priscus: Noted in Siphonobolus by Williams et al. (17), with reference to Havlicek (99). Terebratulina: “In modern terebratulides, the vascula media are subordinate to the lemniscate or pinnate vascula genitalia” – (29) p417. Tomteluva perturbata: Preservation not adequate to evaluate (23). Yuganotheca elegans: Based on the figures and sketches in (46) (and supplementary material), the mantle canals are interpreted as lateral, with no clear vascula media present. [95] vascula terminalia Character 95: Mantle canals: vascula terminalia 0: Exclusively marginal (peripheral) 1: Directed peripherally and (intero)medially Neomorphic character. Presumed to be connected with setal follicles in life (16). See Williams et al. (17) for discussion. Acanthotretella spinosa: Preservation not clear enough to score with certainty (34). Alisina: Interomedial vascula terminalia not reported by Williams et al. (17). Askepasma toddense, Micromitra: Peripheral only (16, 17). Botsfordia, Eoobolus: Following (16), appendix 2.

Terebratulina: Following idealised plectolophous terebratulid of Emig (100). 3.14 Lophophore [96] Tentacle disposition Character 96: Lophophore: Tentacle disposition 1: Single side 2: Both sides Transformational character. Tentacles may occur along one or both sides of the axis of the lophophore arm (85). Acanthotretella spinosa: Preservation insufficient to evaluate (34). Alisina: Preservation inadequate. Heliomedusa orienta: “Each lophophoral arm bears a row of long, slender flexible tentacles” – (47). Kutorgina chengjiangensis: Tentacles “cannot be confidently demonstrated in the available specimens.” – (59). Lingula, Novocrania, Pelagodiscus atlanticus, Phoronis, Terebratulina: Following coding for higher group in (85), appendix 1, character 36. Lingulellotreta malongensis: “The tentacles are clearly visible, and closely arranged in a single palisade” – (101). Lingulosacculus: Preservation insufficient to evaluate. Longtancunella chengjiangensis: Inadequately preserved to evaluate. [97] Tentacle rows per side in trocholophe stage Character 97: Lophophore: Tentacle rows per side in trocholophe stage 0: Single row 1: Ablabial and adlabial row Neomorphic character. After Carlson (85), character 37. Lophophore tentacles are commonly arranged into an ablabial and adlablial row, with ablabial tentacles sometimes added later in development. Lingula, Pelagodiscus atlanticus, Phoronis, Terebratulina: Following coding for higher taxon in Carlson (85), appendix 1, character 37.

Acanthotretella spinosa: Preservation insufficient to evaluate (34). Heliomedusa orienta: “The lophophoral arms bear laterofrontal tentacles with a double row of cilia along their lateral edge, as in extant lingulid brachiopods” – (47). Kutorgina chengjiangensis: Tentacles “cannot be confidently demonstrated in the available specimens.” – (59).

Lingulosacculus: Preservation insufficient to evaluate. Yuganotheca elegans: “helical lophophore fringed with a single row of thick, widely spaced, parallel-sided and hollow tentacles” – (46). [99] Median tentacle in early development Character 99: Lophophore: Median tentacle in early development 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Following character 28 in (85). Certain taxa exhibit a median tentacle early in development that is lost at some point in ontogeny. Acanthotretella spinosa, Alisina, Antigonambonites planus, Askepasma toddense, Clupeafumosus socialis, Coolinia pecten, Dailyatia, Eccentrotheca, Gasconsia, Glyptoria, Haplophrentis carinatus, Heliomedusa orienta, Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Lingulellotreta malongensis, Lingulosacculus, Longtancunella chengjiangensis, Micrina, Micromitra, Mummpikia nuda, Nisusia sulcata, Orthis, Paterimitra, Pedunculotheca diania, Salanygolina, Tomteluva perturbata, Yuganotheca elegans: Lophophore ontogeny presently unknown. [100] Forms closed loop Character 100: Lophophore: Forms closed loop 1: Diverging laterally 2: Closed loop Transformational character. Whereas the lophophore of crown-group brachiopods typically forms a closed loop, those of Haplophrentis and Heliomedusa diverge laterally (14). Lingulosacculus: Two diverging arms of the lophophore are preserved (52). Longtancunella chengjiangensis: Two distinct, diverging arms reconstructed by (51). Nisusia sulcata: No specimens of Nisusia preserve the lophophore. [101] Coiling direction Character 101: Lophophore: Coiling direction 1: Anteriad 2: Posteriad Transformational character. The lophophore arms of Heliomedusa and Haplophrentis arch posteriad, rather than anteriad as in lingulids. See (47); (14). Acanthotretella spinosa, Lingulellotreta malongensis: Arms proceed anteriad before recurving. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: “converging anteriorly and coiling anterior to the body cavity” – (47). Phoronis: Coiling in direction of anus (i.e. posteriad). [102] Adjustor muscle Character 102: Lophophore: Adjustor muscle 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Following character 55 in Carlson (85). Not possible to code in most fossil taxa. Acanthotretella spinosa, Alisina, Antigonambonites planus, Askepasma toddense, Clupeafumosus socialis, Coolinia pecten, Dailyatia, Eccentrotheca, Gasconsia, Glyptoria, Haplophrentis carinatus, Heliomedusa orienta, Kutorgina chengjiangensis, Lingulellotreta malongensis, Lingulosacculus, Longtancunella chengjiangensis, Micrina, Micromitra, Mummpikia nuda, Nisusia sulcata, Orthis, Paterimitra, Pedunculotheca diania, Salanygolina, Tomteluva perturbata, Yuganotheca elegans: Preservation not adequate to evaluate presence or absence of this muscle. Lingula, Novocrania, Pelagodiscus atlanticus, Phoronis, Terebratulina: Following coding for higher taxon in Carlson (85), appendix 1, character 55. 3.15 Prominent pharynx [103] Character 103: Prominent pharynx 0: Absent 1: Present Neomorphic character. Hyoliths exhibit a prominent protrusible muscular pharynx at the base of the lophophore (14). This is considered as potentially equivalent to the anterior projection of the visceral cavity in Heliomedusa, and, by extension, in Lingulosacculus and Lingulotreta. Eoobolus: Prominent extension of dorsal visceral platform (36). Heliomedusa orienta: Corresponding to the “neck” of the vase-shaped visceral cavity reported by (47). Lingulellotreta malongensis: An anterior projection of the visceral area is noted by Williams et al. (17) and considered equivalent to that observed in Lingulosacculus (52). Lingulosacculus: The prominent anterior extension of the visceral area noted by Balthasar &amp; Butterfield (52) is considered as potentially homologous with that of Heliomedusa (47) and, by extension, Haplophrentis (14). Yuganotheca elegans: Possibly present, following interpretation of mouth (46). 3.16 Anus [104] Character 104: Anus 1: Absent: digestive tract is blind sac 2: Present: through-gut Transformational character. The digestive tract may either constitute a blind sac, or a through gut with anus. Glyptoria: Scored according to familial level feature. Kutorgina chengjiangensis: Although “the possibility of a blind ending may not be completely eliminated […] the weight of evidence […] leads us to reject the possibility of a blind-ending intestine” – (59), p. 1399. [105] Migration Character 105: Anus: Migration 0: Not migrated: straight gut with posterior anus 1: Migrated: anus has migrated posteriad to create U-shaped gut Neomorphic character. “The relative position of the mouth and anus in the larvae of brachiopods and phoronids is similar: posterior anus and anterior mouth” – (22), p. 2884. Kutorgina chengjiangensis: “Five specimens have an exceptionally preserved digestive tract, dorsally curved, with a putative dorso-terminal anus located near the proximal end of a pedicle” – (59). Terebratulina: “In rhynchonelliforms, the gut curves somewhat into a C-shape and the (blind) anus becomes posteroventral in position.” – (22), p. 2884. [106] Within ring of tentacles Character 106: Anus: Migration: Within ring of tentacles 1: Not within ring of tentacles 2: Anterior - within ring of feeding tentacles Transformational character. A migrated anus may be located laterally or within the lophophore ring (as in entoprocts). Kutorgina chengjiangensis: “Presumed to terminate in a functional anus located near the proximal end of the pedicle.” – (59). [107] Position Character 107: Anus: Migration: Position 1: Left 2: Right 3: Dorsally 4: Ventrally Transformational character. If the anus is not within the ring of tentacles, in which direction is it oriented?. Haplophrentis carinatus: Opening to the right – see figures 1, 3, and extended data 5 in Moysiuk et al. (14). The text states in error that the anus is to the left of the midline. Kutorgina chengjiangensis: “Five specimens have an exceptionally preserved digestive tract, dorsally curved, with a putative dorso-terminal anus located near the proximal end of a pedicle” – (59). Lingula: “In the lingulids, the [intestine] follows an oblique course anteriorly to open at the anus on the right body wall.” – (29), p. 89. Lingulellotreta malongensis: “finally terminating in an anal opening on the right anterior body wall” (70). Lingulosacculus: “This same arrangement occurs in L. nuda, with the looped dark line tracking the same course as the exceptionally preserved guts of Chengjiang lingulellotretids, including the median position of its posterior loop and the sharp right turn as it exits the posterior extension of the ventral valve” (52). Longtancunella chengjiangensis: “The intestine extends posteriorly, and then turns right to continue as a tortuous strand, finally terminating at the latero-median position of the anterior body wall” – (51). Terebratulina: “In rhynchonelliforms, the gut curves somewhat into a C-shape and the (blind) anus becomes posteroventral in position.” – (22), p. 2884. Yuganotheca elegans: The identification of the “very poorly impressed possible anus at the lateral side of the anterior body wall” is not yet confident, so this character is coded as not presently available.

["taxonomic-implications.html", "6 Taxonomic implications", " 6 Taxonomic implications This section briefly places key features of our results in the context of previous phylogenetic hypotheses. Craniiforms Trimerellids are reconstructed as paraphyletic with respect to Craniiforms. This is consistent with the affinity commonly drawn between these groups (17), and helps to account for the stratigraphically late (Ordovician) appearance of Craniids in the fossil record. (Aragonite is underrepresented in early Palaeozoic strata due to taphonomic bias.) The relationship of Craniiforms with respect to Linguliforms and Rhynchonelliforms remains unclear. Shell characters point to a relationship with the Rhynchonelliforms, which is countered by similarities between the spermatozoa of phoronids and terebratulids, which indicate a craniiform + linguliform clade. It’s worth noting that Bayesian and Fitch analyses place Gasconsia as the basalmost member of the Rhynchonellid lineage, upholding suggestions (???) of a chileid rather than trimerellid affinity. This placement presumably represents an artefact resulting from the incorrect handling of inapplicable data. But if true, Gasconsia would be a close analogue for the common ancestor of Rhynchonelliforms + Craniiforms (+Linguliforms?). Rhynchonelliforms The position of kutorginids within the rhynchonelliform stem lineage has been tricky to resolve (60); we resolve them as paraphyletic with respect to Rhynconellata (which encompasses the obolellate Alisina), which is broadly in accord to previous proposals (27). Chileids form the adelphiotaxon to this clade. Longtancunella (20) nests crownwards of the protorthid Glyptoria, but stemward of the obolellid Alisina. Salanygolina has been interpreted as a stem-group rhynchonelliform based on its combination of paterinid and chileate features (40). Our results position Salanygolina between paterinids and chileids, which directly corroborates this proposed phylogenetic position. Basal rhynchonellids are characterized by a circular umbonal perforation in the ventral valve, associated with a colleplax. Partly on this basis, the aberrant taxa Yuganotheca and Tomteluva plot close to Salanygolina, the three often forming a clade – though the reliability of this grouping is perhaps liable to change as additional data comes to light. Nevertheless, an interpretation of Yuganotheca as a stem-group brachiopod (46) is difficult to reconcile with the increasingly well-constrained nature of the early brachiopod body plan. Linguliforms The reconstruction of Linguloformea comprising Linguloidea as sister to Discinoidea is as expected, though it is notable that Acrotretids and Siphonotretids plot more closely to Linguloidea than Discinoidea does. Lingulellotretids also sit within this lingulid grouping; a position in the phoronid stem lineage (52) is not upheld. More novel is the reconstruction of the calcitic obolellid Mummpikia in the linguliform total group: a rhynchonelliform affinity has been assumed based on its calcitic mineralogy. This said, (26) has highlighted the similarities between obolellids and linguliform brachiopods, including sub-μm vertical canals and the detailed configuration of the posterior shell margin. Our analysis upholds the case for a linguliform affinity for Mummpikia; a calcitic shell seemingly arose through an independent change within this taxon As such, Mummpikia has no direct bearing on the origin of ‘Calciata’, save that shell mineralogy is perhaps less static than commonly assumed. More generally, our results identify Class Obolellata as polyphyletic: Alisina (Trematobolidae) plots within Rhynchonellata; Tomteluva is harder to place, but tends to group with Salanygolina stemwards of the chileids. Paterinids Paterinids have traditionally been placed within the Linguliforms on the basis of their phosphatic shell (22), which our analysis identifies as ancestral within the brachiopod crown group; our analysis places them within the Rhynchonelliforms instead. Characters supporting this position include the strophic hinge line, planar cardinal area, the absence of a pedicle nerve impression, and the morphology of the mantle canals. More generally, although some lingulids can be found which share more generic characters (e.g. shell growth direction) with paterinids, the particular combination of characters exhibited in paterinids does not occur anywhere in the linguliform lineage, but is more similar to that of basal rhynchonelliforms, particularly Salanygolina. Tommotiids Tommotiids represent a basal grade, paraphyletic to phoronids and crown-group brachiopods, in line with previous interpretations. Micrina and Mickwitzia are the most crownwards of the tommotiids, but beyond this, their position is somewhat difficult to pin down; certain analytical configruations reconstruct then as stem-brachiopods; others place them closer to the discinids, the lingulids or the craniiforms. Heliomedusa is commonly associated closely with Mickwitzia, reflecting the similarities emphasized by Holmer and Popov in (22), but plots instead within the Craniiforms under certain analytical conditions, in line with earlier interpretations (17). Hyoliths Hyoliths are interpreted as stem-group Brachiopods, which refines the broader phylogenetic position proposed by (14). This is to say, they sit closer to brachiopods than the phoronids do, but no analysis places them within the Brachiopod crown group. Hyoliths thus represent derived tommotiids, and are the closest relatives to the Brachiopod crown group. References "],
