# Taxonomic implications

This section briefly places key features of our results in the context of previous phylogenetic hypotheses.

Craniiforms
: Trimerellids are reconstructed as paraphyletic with respect to Craniiforms.  
: This is consistent with the affinity commonly drawn between these groups [e.g. @Williams2000BrachiopodaLinguliformea], and helps to account for the stratigraphically late (Ordovician) appearance of Craniids in the fossil record.  (Aragonite is underrepresented in early Palaeozoic strata due to taphonomic bias.)

Rhynchonelliforms
: The position of kutorginids in the brachiopod stem lineage has been tricky to resolve [@Holmer2018Theattachment]; we resolve them as sister to Rhynconellata + Obolellata (represented by _Alisina_), which is broadly in accord to previous proposals [@Holmer2018Evolutionarysignificance].  Chileids form the adelphiotaxon to this clade.
:
: _Salanygolina_ has been interpreted as a stem-group rhynchonelliform based on its combination of paterinid and chileate features [@Holmer2009Theenigmatic].  Our results position _Salanygolina_ between paterinids and chileids, which directly corroborates this proposed phylogenetic position.  Basal rhynchonellids are characterized by a circular umbonal perforation in the ventral valve, associated with a colleplax.

Linguliforms
: The reconstruction of Linguloformea comprising Lingulids (including acrotretids and siphonotretids) as sister to the Discinids is as expected.
: More novel is the reconstruction of _Mummpikia_ in the linguliform stem lineage. Balthasar [-@Balthasar2008iMummpikia] has highlighted the similarities between obolellids and linguliform brachiopods, including sub-&mu;m vertical canals and the detailed configuration of the posterior shell margin.
: This notwithstanding, a rhynchonelliform affinity has been assumed based on its Its calcitic mineralogy.  Our analysis upholds the case for a linguliform affinity; its calcitic shell seemingly arose through an independent change within this lineage.  As such, _Mummpikia_ has no direct relevance to the origin of 'Calciata'.

Tommotiids
: Tommotiids represent a basal grade, paraphyletic to crown-group brachiopods, in line with previous interpretations.  The tree is somewhat arbitrarily rooted on _Dailyatia_, so it is worth considering the possibility that the root lies elsewhere.  In any case, _Micrina_ (+ _Paterimitra_?) represents the most crownward tommotiid.

Hyoliths
: Hyoliths are interpreted as stem-group Brachiopods, which refines the broader phylogenetic position proposed by Moysiuk _et al_. [-@Moysiuk2017Hyolithsare].  Perhaps more surprising is their close relationships with a clade of soft-shelled conical brachiopods, _Acanthotretella_, _Lingulosacculus_ and _Lingulellotreta_.  These taxa are united by a long ventral pseudointerarea -- a conical extension of the valve occupied by soft tissue, including the gut.
: There is some precendent for this relationship: _Lingulosacculus_ has previously been linked with _Lingulellotreta_ [@Balthasar2009EarlyCambrian] and hyoliths [@Moysiuk2017Hyolithsare].  What is more, the phylogenetic position of these taxa has been contested; a lingulid affinity has generally been assumed, but positions further from the crown group have been proposed: indeed _Lingulosacculus_ has previously been reconstructed in the phoronid stem lineage [@Balthasar2009EarlyCambrian].  
: An association with hyolithids reconciles these to opposite interpretations.  The unusual properties of the lingulelotretid-like taxa can be explained by their early phylogenetic branching, whereas their lingulid-like morphology denotes that the earliest brachiopods resembled modern lingulids.

_Yuganotheca_, _Tomteluva_, _Longtancunella_, Acrotretids
: The position of certain eccentric taxa is not robustly constrained; we opt not to hang too much on these results that are liable to change as additional data comes to light.  That said, it is notable that _Yuganotheca_ does consistently occur within the rhynchonelliform stem lineage, often in association with _Salanygolina_, suggesting that they represent aberrant offshoots of this lineage.  This places them within the brachiopod crown-group; a position in the stem lineage [@Zhang2014Anearly] is difficult to reconcile with the increasingly well-constrained nature rise of the brachiopods body plan.
