Smith, Han Zeng, Fangchen Zhao, Guoxiang Li and Maoyan Zhu 2018-06-18 Supplementary Text This document comtains supplementary material to Sun et al. (2018). It describes the morphological dataset and the results of tree searches using Fitch parsimony and a Bayesian method: approaches that are subject to errors resulting from logically incoherent treatment of inapplicable data (Maddison, 1993). We also present the results of tree searches with the algorithm described by Brazeau, Guillerme, &amp; Smith (2018), which correctly handles inapplicable data in a parsimony setting. Finally, we document how each character is most parsimoniously reconstructed on optimal trees. Supplementary figures and tables appear after the text. References "],
["dataset.html", "1 Phylogenetic dataset", " 1 Phylogenetic dataset Analysis was performed on a new matrix of 54 lophotrochozoan taxa, coded for 225 morphological characters (129 neomorphic, 96 transformational). The matrix can be viewed interactively at Morphobank (project 2800) [This dataset will be released on publication of the paper. Referee access is availble by logging in to MorphoBank using the e-mail address and password given in the manuscript.]; a static version can be downloaded directly in raw.githubusercontent.com/ms609/hyoliths/master/mbank_X24932_6-15-2018_519.nex or TNT format. Taxa include sipunculans and molluscs, which have previously been interpreted as having affinities with hyoliths. Other lophotrochozoan groups help to constrain the outgroup topology, and a diversity of brachiozoans helps to resolve the position of hyoliths within this group. Characters are coded following the recommendations of Brazeau et al. (2018): We have employed reductive coding, using a distinct state to mark character inapplicability. Character specifications follow the structural syntax of Sereno (2007) in order to highlight ontological dependence between characters and emphasize the structure of the dataset. We have distinguished between neomorphic and transformational characters (sensu Sereno, 2007) by reserving the token 0 to refer to the absence of a neomorphic (i.e. presence/absence) character. The states of transformational characters (i.e. characters that describe a property of a feature) are represented by the tokens 1, 2, 3, … We code the absence of neomorphic ontologically dependent characters (sensu Vogt, 2017) as absence, rather than inapplicability. The complete dataset comprises 12150 character codings, of which 1133 are inapplicable and 4975 were positive statements (i.e. neither ambiguous nor inapplicable). This latter value, the amount and quality of data that is coded, is more instructive than the number of cells that are ambiguous (Wiens, 1998, 2003). Of the 225 characters, the number that were coded with an applicable token for each taxon is: Acanthotretella spinosa 70 Gasconsia 70 Novocrania 186 Alisina 84 Glyptoria 73 Orthis 70 Amathia 157 Halkieria evangelista 65 Paramicrocornus 57 Antigonambonites planus 85 Haplophrentis carinatus 82 Paterimitra 67 Askepasma toddense 78 Heliomedusa orienta 67 Pauxillites 56 Bactrotheca 53 Kutorgina chengjiangensis 84 Pedunculotheca diania 63 Botsfordia 75 Lingula 205 Pelagodiscus atlanticus 166 Clupeafumosus socialis 76 Lingulellotreta malongensis 87 Phoronis 169 Conotheca 60 Lingulosacculus 60 Salanygolina 79 Coolinia pecten 80 Longtancunella chengjiangensis 61 Serpula 170 Cotyledion tylodes 65 Loxosomella 164 Siphonobolus priscus 74 Craniops 66 Maxilites 61 Sipunculus 168 Cupitheca holocyclata 63 Mickwitzia muralensis 72 Terebratulina 184 Dailyatia 55 Micrina 71 Tomteluva perturbata 58 Dentalium 169 Micromitra 81 Tonicella 188 Eccentrotheca 54 Mummpikia nuda 55 Ussunia 53 Eoobolus 81 Namacalathus 59 Wiwaxia corrugata 75 Flustra 168 Nisusia sulcata 80 Yuganotheca elegans 56 References "],

["bayesian.html", "3 Bayesian analysis 3.1 Parameter estimates 3.2 Results", " 3 Bayesian analysis Bayesian search was conducted in MrBayes v3.2.6 (Ronquist et al., 2012) using the Mk model (Lewis, 2001) with gamma-distributed rate variation across characters: lset coding=variable rates=gamma; Branch length was drawn from a dirichlet prior distribution, which is less informative than an exponential model (Rannala, Zhu, &amp; Yang, 2012), but requires a prior mean tree length within about two orders of magnitude of the true value (C. Zhang, Rannala, &amp; Yang, 2012). To satisfy this latter criterion, we specified the prior mean tree length to be equal to the length of the most parsimonious tree under equal weights, using a Dirichlet prior with \\(\\alpha_T = 1\\), \\(\\beta_T = 1/(\\)equal weights tree length\\(/\\)number of characters\\()\\), \\(\\alpha = c = 1\\): prset brlenspr = unconstrained: gammadir(1, 0.35, 1, 1); Neomorphic and transformational characters (sensu Sereno, 2007) were allocated to two separate partitions whose proportion of invariant characters and gamma shape parameters were allowed to vary independently: charset Neomorphic = 1 6 7 9 10 15 18 19 20 21 22 24 26 29 30 34 35 37 38 40 43 44 45 48 49 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 65 66 68 69 71 76 78 79 80 81 83 86 87 88 91 92 93 94 97 98 99 100 101 102 106 108 109 111 118 119 121 122 125 126 129 136 137 138 139 140 142 143 144 145 148 150 151 153 154 155 156 157 158 160 164 168 170 174 175 176 177 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 190 192 193 196 199 202 203 204 205 206 207 209 210 211 212 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 222 225; charset Transformational = 2 3 4 5 8 11 12 13 14 16 17 23 25 27 28 31 32 33 36 39 41 42 46 47 50 51 52 62 63 64 67 70 72 73 74 75 77 82 84 85 89 90 95 96 103 104 105 107 110 112 113 114 115 116 117 120 123 124 127 128 130 131 132 133 134 135 141 146 147 149 152 159 161 162 163 165 166 167 169 171 172 173 178 189 191 194 195 197 198 200 201 208 213 221 223 224; partition chartype = 2: Neomorphic, Transformational; set partition = chartype; unlink shape=(all) pinvar=(all); Neomorphic characters were not assumed to have a symmetrical transition rate – that is, the probability of the absent → present transition was allowed to differ from that of the present → absent transition, being drawn from a uniform prior: prset applyto=(1) symdirihyperpr=fixed(1.0); The rate of variation in neomorphic characters was also allowed to vary from that of transformational characters: prset applyto=(1) ratepr=variable; Loxosomella was selected as an outgroup: outgroup Loxosomella; Four MrBayes runs were executed, each sampling eight chains for 5 000 000 generations, with samples taken every 500 generations.

["treesearch.html", "4 Corrected parsimony 4.1 Search parameters 4.2 Analysis 4.3 Results", " 4 Corrected parsimony The phylogenetic dataset contains a considerable proportion of inapplicable codings (1133/12150 = 9.3% of tokens), which are known to introduce error and bias to phylogenetic reconstruction when the Fitch algorithm is employed (Brazeau et al., 2018; Maddison, 1993). As such, we employed a new tree-scoring algorithm that correctly handles inapplicable data (Brazeau et al., 2018), implemented in the MorphyLib C library (Brazeau, Smith, &amp; Guillerme, 2017). We employed the R package TreeSearch v0.1.2 (Smith, 2018) to conduct phylogenetic tree search with this algorithm. 4.1 Search parameters Heuristic searches were conducted using the parsimony ratchet (Nixon, 1999) under equal and implied weights (Goloboff, 1997). The consensus tree presented in the main manuscript represents a strict consensus of all trees that are most parsimonious under one or more of the concavity constants (k) 2, 3, 4.5, 7, 10.5, 16 and 24, an approach that has been shown to produce higher accuracy (i.e. more nodes and quartets resolved correctly) than equal weights at any given level of precision (Smith, 2017). 4.2 Analysis The R commands used to conduct the analysis are reproduced below. The results can most readily be replicated using the R markdown files (.Rmd) used to generate these pages: in Rstudio, run index.Rmd, then run each block in TreeSearch.Rmd.

["reconstructions.html", "5 Character reconstructions", " 5 Character reconstructions This page provides definitions for each of the characters in our matrix, and justifies codings in particular taxa where relevant. Further citations for codings that are not discussed in the text can be viewed by browsing the morphological dataset on MorphoBank (project 2800). [This dataset will be released on publication of the paper. Referee access is availble by logging in to MorphoBank using the e-mail address and password given in the manuscript.] Alongside its definition, each character has been mapped onto a tree. Any of the optimal trees can be selected by modifying the tree number listed above each diagram. Each tip is labelled according to its coding in the matrix. These states have been used to reconstruct the condition of each internal node, using the parsimony method of Brazeau et al. (2018) as implemented in the R package Inapp. We emphasize that different trees will give different reconstructions. The character mappings are not intended to definitively establish how each character evolved, but to help the reader quickly establish how each character has been coded, and to visualize at a glance how each character fits onto a given tree.

["taxonomic-implications.html", "6 Taxonomic implications", " 6 Taxonomic implications This section briefly places key features of our results in the context of previous phylogenetic hypotheses. Outgroup We advise caution in the interpretation of outgroup relationships. Outgroup taxa include single representatives of diverse and ancient phyla, and are thus prone to long branch error (Parks &amp; Goldman, 2014). The relationships of the lophotrochozoan phyla were not the primary object of this study, and have long resisted elucidation; this said, we have attempted to incorporate all morphological evidence that has been interpreted as informing relationships between these groups. Brachiopod crown and stem group Crown- and stem-group terminology has great value in clarifying the early evolution of major lineages (Budd &amp; Jensen, 2000; Carlson &amp; Cohen, 2009). The crown group of a lineage is defined as the last common ancestor of all living members of a group, and all its descendants; the stem group as all taxa more closely related to the crown group than to any other extant taxon. In our selection of taxa, the brachiopod crown group corresponds to the last common ancestor of Terebratulina, Novocrania, Pelagodiscus and Lingula; the brachiopod stem group comprises anything between this node and the branching point of Phoronis, which marks the base of the Brachiozoan crown group. Craniiforms Trimerellids are reconstructed as paraphyletic with respect to Craniiforms. This is consistent with the affinity commonly drawn between these groups (e.g. Williams et al., 2000), and helps to account for the stratigraphically late (Ordovician) appearance of Craniids in the fossil record. (Aragonite is underrepresented in early Palaeozoic strata due to taphonomic bias.) The position of the craniiforms is not conclusively resolved; shell characters point to a relationship with the Rhynchonelliforms, which is countered by similarities between the spermatozoa of phoronids and terebratulids, indicating a craniiform + linguliform clade. This latter relationship is preferred by the majority of parsimony analyses, though a small subset of weighting parameters places the craniiform clade within the rhynchonelliforms instead. The Bayesian results offer a more surprising interpretation that places the craniiforms as paraphyletic with respect to all other brachiopods, with Gasconsia representing the basalmost member of the Rhynchonellid lineage, upholding suggestions (Holmer, Popov, &amp; Bassett, 2014) of a chileid rather than trimerellid affinity. To our knowledge, the hypothesis of a paraphyletic craniiform+trimerellid grade has never been proposed, and represents a poor fit to stratigraphic data; potentially it represents an artefact resulting from the incorrect handling of inapplicable data within the Mk model. Rhynchonelliforms The position of kutorginids within the rhynchonelliform stem lineage has been tricky to resolve (Holmer, Zhang, Topper, Popov, &amp; Claybourn, 2018); our results agree that they form a clade, but differ on their closest relatives; Fitch parsimony places them as sister to the Chileids; correcting for inapplicables places them sister to Rhynchonelliforms; and Bayesian analysis fails to distinguish between these two possibilities. These results are broadly in accord with previous proposals (Holmer et al., 2018). The protorthid Glyptoria is the earliest diverging of the included rhynchonelliform lineages. Salanygolina has been interpreted as a stem-group rhynchonelliform based on its combination of paterinid and chileate features (Holmer, Pettersson Stolk, Skovsted, Balthasar, &amp; Popov, 2009). Our results position Salanygolina as sister either to the Chileids or the Chileids + Rhynchonelliforms, corroborating this interpretation. Basal rhynchonellids are characterized by a circular umbonal perforation in the ventral valve, associated with a colleplax. Partly on this basis, the aberrant taxa Yuganotheca and Tomteluva tend to plot close to the chileids under Fitch and Bayesian analysis, though a variety of positions in this region of the tree are equally plausible. The BGS method, in contrast, supports the interpretation of Yuganotheca as a stem-group brachiopod (Zhang et al., 2014). Linguliforms The reconstruction of Linguloformea comprising Linguloidea as sister to Discinoidea is as expected. Lingulellotretids also sit within this linguliform grouping; a position in the phoronid stem lineage (advocated by Balthasar &amp; Butterfield, 2009) is not upheld. Acrotretids and Siphonotretids form a clade with Lingulosacculus. More novel is the reconstruction of the calcitic obolellid Mummpikia in the linguliform total group: a rhynchonelliform affinity has been assumed based on its calcitic mineralogy. This said, Balthasar (2008) has highlighted the similarities between obolellids and linguliform brachiopods, including sub-μm vertical canals and the detailed configuration of the posterior shell margin. Our analysis upholds the case for a linguliform affinity for Mummpikia; a calcitic shell seemingly arose through an independent change within this taxon As such, Mummpikia has no direct bearing on the origin of ‘Calciata’, save that shell mineralogy is perhaps less static than commonly assumed. More generally, our results identify Class Obolellata as polyphyletic: Alisina (Trematobolidae) plots within Rhynchonellata; Tomteluva is harder to place, but tends to group with Salanygolina stemwards of the chileids. Paterinids Paterinids have traditionally been placed within the Linguliforms on the basis of their phosphatic shell (Williams et al., 2007), which we identify as ancestral within the brachiopod crown group; consequently, our analysis places the paterinids within the Rhynchonelliforms instead. Characters supporting this position include the strophic hinge line, planar cardinal area, the absence of a pedicle nerve impression, and the morphology of the mantle canals. More generally, although some lingulids can be found which share more generic characters (e.g. shell growth direction) with paterinids, the particular combination of characters exhibited in paterinids does not occur anywhere in the linguliform lineage, but is more similar to that of basal rhynchonelliforms, particularly Salanygolina (as noted by Holmer et al., 2009). Tommotiids Tommotiids represent a basal grade, paraphyletic to phoronids and crown-group brachiopods, in line with previous interpretations. Mickwitzia is consistently the most crownwards of the tommotiids, falling as sister to the brachiopod crown group (except in the Bayesian results, where they fall within the paraphyletic craniiform grade). Mickwitzia is closely related to Micrina and Heliomedusa, though the exact nature of this relationship varies from analysis to analysis. The latter affilitation reflects similarities emphasized by Holmer and Popov in Williams et al. (2007). Dailyatia tends to plot closely with Halkieria, reflecting the similarity in the form of their proposed scleritome (Skovsted, Betts, Topper, &amp; Brock, 2015). Bayesian analysis recovers this pair as sister to annelids and molluscs; Fitch parsimony places them in the molluscan stem group. Inapplicable-corrected parsimony instead places these taxa as sister to hyoliths + brachiopods (cf. Zhao et al., 2017). Hyoliths Within the hyoliths, orthothecids are consistently recovered as a grade that is paraphyletic to the hyolithids. Hyoliths as a whole are interpreted as stem-group Brachiopods, which refines the broader phylogenetic position proposed by Moysiuk, Smith, &amp; Caron (2017). This is to say, they sit closer to brachiopods than the phoronids do, but no analysis places them within the Brachiopod crown group. Tommotiids lie both stemwards (e.g. Eccentrotheca) and crownwards (Mickwitzia) of hyoliths, which thus represent derived tommotiids. References "],

Provenance of fossil material. Individuals from the Yaoying section are usually bigger, with a thicker body wall, and have a smaller ratio of apertural width to shell length than specimens from other areas. In the absence of other differentiating features, we consider these deviations to represent ecophenotypical variation within a single species, perhaps reflecting the increased energetics and predation pressure that accompany the shallower water depth reported at the Yaoying section (Zhao et al., 2012).
