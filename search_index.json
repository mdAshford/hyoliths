It describes the morphological dataset and the results of tree searches using Fitch parsimony and a Bayesian method: approaches that are subject to errors resulting from logically incoherent treatment of inapplicable data (Maddison, 1993). We also present the results of tree searches with the algorithm described by Brazeau, Guillerme, &amp; Smith (2018), which correctly handles inapplicable data in a parsimony setting.

As a brachiozoan affinity is indicated, additional brachiozoan taxa were incorporated in order to resolve the position of hyoliths within this group. Characters are coded following the recommendations of Brazeau et al. (2018): We have employed reductive coding, using a distinct state to mark character inapplicability. Character specifications follow the structural syntax of Sereno (2007) in order to highlight ontological dependence between characters and emphasize the structure of the dataset. We have distinguished between neomorphic and transformational characters (sensu Sereno, 2007) by reserving the token 0 to refer to the absence of a neomorphic (i.e. presence/absence) character. The states of transformational characters (i.e. characters that describe a property of a feature) are represented by the tokens 1, 2, 3, … We code the absence of neomorphic ontologically dependent characters (sensu Vogt, 2017) as absence, rather than inapplicability. The complete dataset comprises 12150 character codings, of which 1133 are inapplicable and 4975 were positive statements (i.e. neither ambiguous nor inapplicable). This latter value, the amount and quality of data that is coded, is more instructive than the number of cells that are ambiguous (Wiens, 1998, 2003). Of the 225 characters, the number that were coded with an applicable token for each taxon is: Acanthotretella spinosa 70 Gasconsia 70 Novocrania 186 Alisina 84 Glyptoria 73 Orthis 70 Amathia 157 Halkieria evangelista 65 Paramicrocornus 57 Antigonambonites planus 85 Haplophrentis carinatus 82 Paterimitra 67 Askepasma toddense 78 Heliomedusa orienta 67 Pauxillites 56 Bactrotheca 53 Kutorgina chengjiangensis 84 Pedunculotheca diania 63 Botsfordia 75 Lingula 205 Pelagodiscus atlanticus 166 Clupeafumosus socialis 76 Lingulellotreta malongensis 87 Phoronis 169 Conotheca 60 Lingulosacculus 60 Salanygolina 79 Coolinia pecten 80 Longtancunella chengjiangensis 61 Serpula 170 Cotyledion tylodes 65 Loxosomella 164 Siphonobolus priscus 74 Craniops 66 Maxilites 61 Sipunculus 168 Cupitheca holocyclata 63 Mickwitzia muralensis 72 Terebratulina 184 Dailyatia 55 Micrina 71 Tomteluva perturbata 58 Dentalium 169 Micromitra 81 Tonicella 188 Eccentrotheca 54 Mummpikia nuda 55 Ussunia 53 Eoobolus 81 Namacalathus 59 Wiwaxia corrugata 75 Flustra 168 Nisusia sulcata 80 Yuganotheca elegans 56 References "],

["treesearch.html", "4 Parsimony analysis 4.1 Search parameters 4.2 Analysis 4.3 Results", " 4 Parsimony analysis The phylogenetic dataset contains a considerable proportion of inapplicable codings (1133/12150 = 9.3% of tokens), which are known to introduce error and bias to phylogenetic reconstruction when the Fitch algorithm is employed (Brazeau et al., 2018; Maddison, 1993). As such, we employed a new tree-scoring algorithm that correctly handles inapplicable data (Brazeau et al., 2018), implemented in the MorphyLib C library (Brazeau, Smith, &amp; Guillerme, 2017). We employed the R package TreeSearch v0.1.2 (Smith, 2018) to conduct phylogenetic tree search with this algorithm. 4.1 Search parameters Heuristic searches were conducted using the parsimony ratchet (Nixon, 1999) under equal and implied weights (Goloboff, 1997). The consensus tree presented in the main manuscript represents a strict consensus of all trees that are most parsimonious under one or more of the concavity constants (k) 2, 3, 4.5, 7, 10.5, 16 and 24, an approach that has been shown to produce higher accuracy (i.e. more nodes and quartets resolved correctly) than equal weights at any given level of precision (Smith, 2017). 4.2 Analysis The R commands used to conduct the analysis are reproduced below.

Alongside its definition, each character has been mapped onto a tree. Any of the optimal trees can be selected by modifying the tree number listed above each diagram. Each tip is labelled according to its coding in the matrix. These states have been used to reconstruct the condition of each internal node, using the parsimony method of Brazeau et al. (2018) as implemented in the Inapp R package. We emphasize that different trees will give different reconstructions. The character mappings are not intended to definitively establish how each character evolved, but to help the reader quickly establish how each character has been coded, and to visualize at a glance how each character fits onto a given tree.

["taxonomic-implications.html", "6 Taxonomic implications", " 6 Taxonomic implications This section briefly places key features of our results in the context of previous phylogenetic hypotheses. Outgroup We advise caution in the interpretation of outgroup relationships. Outgroup taxa include single representatives of diverse and ancient phyla, and are thus prone to long branch error. The relationships of the lophotrochozoan phyla were not the primary object of this study, and have long resisted elucidation; this said, we have attempted to incorporate all morphological evidence that has been interpreted as informing relationships between these groups. Brachiopod crown and stem group Crown- and stem-group terminology has great value in clarifying the early evolution of major lineages (Budd &amp; Jensen, 2000; Carlson &amp; Cohen, 2009). The crown group of a lineage is defined as the last common ancestor of all living members of a group, and all its descendants; the stem group as all taxa more closely related to the crown group than to any other extant taxon. In our analyses, the brachiopod crown group corresponds to the last common ancestor of Terebratulina and Lingula; the brachiopod stem group comprises anything between this node and the branching point of Phoronis. Craniiforms Trimerellids are reconstructed as paraphyletic with respect to Craniiforms. This is consistent with the affinity commonly drawn between these groups (e.g. Williams et al., 2000), and helps to account for the stratigraphically late (Ordovician) appearance of Craniids in the fossil record. (Aragonite is underrepresented in early Palaeozoic strata due to taphonomic bias.) The relationship of Craniiforms with respect to Linguliforms and Rhynchonelliforms remains unclear. Shell characters point to a relationship with the Rhynchonelliforms, which is countered by similarities between the spermatozoa of phoronids and terebratulids, which indicate a craniiform + linguliform clade. It’s worth noting that Bayesian and Fitch analyses place Gasconsia as the basalmost member of the Rhynchonellid lineage, upholding suggestions (Holmer, Popov, &amp; Bassett, 2014) of a chileid rather than trimerellid affinity. This placement presumably represents an artefact resulting from the incorrect handling of inapplicable data. But if true, Gasconsia would be a close analogue for the common ancestor of Rhynchonelliforms + Craniiforms (+Linguliforms?). Rhynchonelliforms The position of kutorginids within the rhynchonelliform stem lineage has been tricky to resolve (Holmer, Zhang, Topper, Popov, &amp; Claybourn, 2018); we resolve them as paraphyletic with respect to Rhynconellata (which encompasses the obolellate Alisina), which is broadly in accord to previous proposals (Holmer et al., 2018). Chileids form the adelphiotaxon to this clade. Longtancunella (Zhang, Holmer, Ou, Han, &amp; Shu, 2011) nests crownwards of the protorthid Glyptoria, but stemward of the obolellid Alisina. Salanygolina has been interpreted as a stem-group rhynchonelliform based on its combination of paterinid and chileate features (Holmer, Pettersson Stolk, Skovsted, Balthasar, &amp; Popov, 2009). Our results position Salanygolina between paterinids and chileids, which directly corroborates this proposed phylogenetic position. Basal rhynchonellids are characterized by a circular umbonal perforation in the ventral valve, associated with a colleplax. Partly on this basis, the aberrant taxa Yuganotheca and Tomteluva plot close to Salanygolina, the three often forming a clade – though the reliability of this grouping is perhaps liable to change as additional data comes to light. Nevertheless, an interpretation of Yuganotheca as a stem-group brachiopod (Zhang et al., 2014) is difficult to reconcile with the increasingly well-constrained nature of the early brachiopod body plan. Linguliforms The reconstruction of Linguloformea comprising Linguloidea as sister to Discinoidea is as expected, though it is notable that Acrotretids and Siphonotretids plot more closely to Linguloidea than Discinoidea does. Lingulellotretids also sit within this lingulid grouping; a position in the phoronid stem lineage (advocated by Balthasar &amp; Butterfield, 2009) is not upheld. More novel is the reconstruction of the calcitic obolellid Mummpikia in the linguliform total group: a rhynchonelliform affinity has been assumed based on its calcitic mineralogy. This said, Balthasar (2008) has highlighted the similarities between obolellids and linguliform brachiopods, including sub-μm vertical canals and the detailed configuration of the posterior shell margin. Our analysis upholds the case for a linguliform affinity for Mummpikia; a calcitic shell seemingly arose through an independent change within this taxon As such, Mummpikia has no direct bearing on the origin of ‘Calciata’, save that shell mineralogy is perhaps less static than commonly assumed. More generally, our results identify Class Obolellata as polyphyletic: Alisina (Trematobolidae) plots within Rhynchonellata; Tomteluva is harder to place, but tends to group with Salanygolina stemwards of the chileids. Paterinids Paterinids have traditionally been placed within the Linguliforms on the basis of their phosphatic shell (Williams et al., 2007), which our analysis identifies as ancestral within the brachiopod crown group; our analysis places them within the Rhynchonelliforms instead. Characters supporting this position include the strophic hinge line, planar cardinal area, the absence of a pedicle nerve impression, and the morphology of the mantle canals. More generally, although some lingulids can be found which share more generic characters (e.g. shell growth direction) with paterinids, the particular combination of characters exhibited in paterinids does not occur anywhere in the linguliform lineage, but is more similar to that of basal rhynchonelliforms, particularly Salanygolina. Tommotiids Tommotiids represent a basal grade, paraphyletic to phoronids and crown-group brachiopods, in line with previous interpretations. Micrina and Mickwitzia are the most crownwards of the tommotiids, but beyond this, their position is somewhat difficult to pin down; certain analytical configruations reconstruct then as stem-brachiopods; others place them closer to the discinids, the lingulids or the craniiforms. Heliomedusa is commonly associated closely with Mickwitzia, reflecting the similarities emphasized by Holmer and Popov in Williams et al. (2007), but plots instead within the Craniiforms under certain analytical conditions, in line with earlier interpretations (Williams et al., 2000). Hyoliths Hyoliths are interpreted as stem-group Brachiopods, which refines the broader phylogenetic position proposed by Moysiuk, Smith, &amp; Caron (2017). This is to say, they sit closer to brachiopods than the phoronids do, but no analysis places them within the Brachiopod crown group. Hyoliths thus represent derived tommotiids, and are the closest relatives to the Brachiopod crown group. References "],
