# Bayesian analysis {#bayesian}

```{R mrbayes-ini, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
files <- list.files('MrBayes', pattern='^hyo\\..*\\.t$', full.names=TRUE)
Mgen <- 5

bayesTrees <- lapply(files, read.nexus)
nTrees <- length(bayesTrees[[1]])

postBurnin <- lapply(bayesTrees, function (x) x[ceiling(nTrees * 0.1):nTrees])
```

Bayesian search was conducted in MrBayes v3.2.6 [@Ronquist2012] using the Mk model [@Lewis2001] with gamma-distributed rate variation across characters:

> lset coding=variable rates=gamma;

Branch length was drawn from a dirichlet prior distribution, which is less informative than an exponential model [@Rannala2012], but requires a prior mean tree length within about two orders of magnitude of the true value [@Zhang2012]. To satisfy this latter criterion, we specified the prior mean tree length to be equal to the length of the most parsimonious tree under equal weights, using a Dirichlet prior with $\alpha_T = 1$, $\beta_T = 1/($_equal weights tree length_$/$_number of characters_$)$, $\alpha = c = 1$:

> prset brlenspr = unconstrained: gammadir(1, `r signif(attr(my_data, 'nr')/Fitch(ew.trees[[1]], my_data), 2)`, 1, 1);

Neomorphic and transformational characters [_sensu_ @Sereno2007] were allocated to two separate partitions whose proportion of invariant characters and gamma shape parameters were allowed to vary independently:

> charset Neomorphic = `r paste(which(neomorphic), collapse=' ')`;
>
> charset Transformational = `r paste(which(!neomorphic), collapse=' ')`;
>
>
> partition chartype = 2: Neomorphic, Transformational;
>
> set partition = chartype;
>
>
> unlink shape=(all) pinvar=(all);


Neomorphic characters were not assumed to have a symmetrical transition rate – that is, the probability of the absent → present transition was allowed to differ from that of the present → absent transition, being drawn from a uniform prior:

> prset applyto=(1) symdirihyperpr=fixed(1.0);

The rate of variation in neomorphic characters was also allowed to vary from that of transformational characters:

> prset applyto=(1) ratepr=variable;

_`r outgroup`_ was selected as an outgroup:

> outgroup `r outgroup`;

Four MrBayes runs were executed, each sampling eight chains for `r Mgen`&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 generations, with samples taken every 500 generations.  The first 10% of samples were discarded as burn-in.

> mcmcp ngen=`r Mgen`000000 samplefreq=500 nruns=4 nchains=8 burninfrac=0.1;

A posterior tree topology was derived from the combined posterior sample of all runs. Convergence was indicated by PSRF = 1.00 and an estimated sample size of > 200 for each parameter.

## Parameter estimates

```{R mrbayes-parameter-summary, echo=FALSE, asis=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
pstat <- read.table('MrBayes/hyo.nex.pstat', skip=1, header=TRUE)[, -c(4:6)]
pstat[, 2:5] <- signif(pstat[, 2:5], 3)
pstat[, 6] <- signif(pstat[, 6], 5)
knitr::kable(pstat)
```
