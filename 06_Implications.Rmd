# Taxonomic implications

This section briefly places key features of our results in the context of previous phylogenetic hypotheses.

Craniiforms
: Trimerellids are reconstructed as paraphyletic with respect to Craniiforms.  
: This is consistent with the affinity commonly drawn between these groups [e.g. @Williams2000BrachiopodaLinguliformea], and helps to account for the stratigraphically late (Ordovician) appearance of Craniids in the fossil record.  (Aragonite is underrepresented in early Palaeozoic strata due to taphonomic bias.)
: The relationship of Craniiforms with respect to Linguliforms and Rhynchonelliforms remains uncertain.  Shell characters point to a relationship with the Rhynchonelliforms, which is countered by similarities between the spermatozoa of phoronids and terebratulids, which indicate to a craniiform + linguliform clade.

Rhynchonelliforms
: The position of kutorginids in the rhynchonelliform stem lineage has been tricky to resolve [@Holmer2018Theattachment]; we resolve them as paraphyletic with respect to Rhynconellata + Obolellata (represented by _Alisina_), which is broadly in accord to previous proposals [@Holmer2018Evolutionarysignificance].  Chileids form the adelphiotaxon to this clade.  _Longtancunella_  [@Zhang2011Theexceptionally] nests crownwards of the protorthid _Glyptoria_, but stemward of the obolellid _Alisina_. 
:
: _Salanygolina_ has been interpreted as a stem-group rhynchonelliform based on its combination of paterinid and chileate features [@Holmer2009Theenigmatic].  Our results position _Salanygolina_ between paterinids and chileids, which directly corroborates this proposed phylogenetic position.  
:Basal rhynchonellids are characterized by a circular umbonal perforation in the ventral valve, associated with a colleplax.
:Partly on this basis, the aberrant taxa _Yuganotheca_ and _Tomteluva_ plot close to _Salanygolina_, the three often forming a clade -- though the reliability of this grouping is perhaps liable to change as additional data comes to light.  _Yuganotheca_ is, however, consistently located within the brachiopod crown-group; a position in the stem lineage [@Zhang2014Anearly] is difficult to reconcile with the increasingly well-constrained nature of the early brachiopod body plan.

Linguliforms
: The reconstruction of Linguloformea comprising Lingulids (including acrotretids and siphonotretids) as sister to the Discinids is as expected.
: Lingulellotretids also sit within this linguliform grouping; a position in the phoronid stem lineage [advocated by @Balthasar2009EarlyCambrian] is not upheld.
: More novel is the reconstruction of _Mummpikia_ in the linguliform total group: a rhynchonelliform affinity has been assumed based on its Its calcitic mineralogy.   This said, Balthasar [-@Balthasar2008iMummpikia] has highlighted the similarities between obolellids and linguliform brachiopods, including sub-&mu;m vertical canals and the detailed configuration of the posterior shell margin.
Our analysis upholds the case for a linguliform affinity; a calcitic shell seemingly arose through an independent change within this taxon  As such, _Mummpikia_ has no direct bearing on the origin of 'Calciata', save that shell mineralogy is perhaps less static than commonly assumed.

Tommotiids
: Tommotiids represent a basal grade, paraphyletic to phoronids and crown-group brachiopods, in line with previous interpretations.  
: The position of _Micrina_ and _Mickwitzia_ is somewhat difficult to pin down; certain analytical configruations reconstruct then as stem-brachiopods; others place them closer to the discinids or the craniiforms.  _Heliomedusa_ is commonly associated closely with _Mickwitzia_, reflecting the similarities emphasized by Holmer and Popov in @Williams2007PartH.

Hyoliths
: Hyoliths are interpreted as stem-group Brachiopods, which refines the broader phylogenetic position proposed by @Moysiuk2017Hyolithsare.  <mark>This is to say, they sit crownwards of phoronids</mark>, but no analysis places them within the Brachiopod crown group.
: Hyoliths are interpreted as derived tommotiids; their precise position varies based on analytical details, but they tend to plot close to _Paterimitra_.  They represent an early and potentially independent move to a closed filtration chamber within the Brachiopod lineage.
