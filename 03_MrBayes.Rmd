# Bayesian analysis

```{R, echo=FALSE}
files <- list.files(paste0(cd, 'MrBayes/'), pattern='^hyo\\..*\\.t$', full.names=TRUE)

allTrees <- lapply(files, read.nexus)
nTrees <- length(allTrees[[1]])

postBurnin <- lapply(allTrees, function (x) x[ceiling(nTrees * 0.1):nTrees])
```

Bayesian search was conducted in MrBayes v3.2.6 [@Ronquist2012] using the M_k_ model [@Lewis2001] with a gamma parameter (`lset coding=variable rates=gamma;`). 
Branch length was drawn from a dirichlet prior distribution, which is less informative than an exponential model ([@Rannala2012], but requires a prior mean tree length within about two orders of magnitude of the true value [@Zhang2012]. To satisfy this latter criterion, we specified the prior mean tree length to be equal to the length of the most parsimonious tree under equal weights (i.e. `prset brlenspr = unconstrained: gammadir(1,0.33,1,1);` $α_T = 1$, $β_T = 1/$(_equal weights tree length_ / _number of characters_), $α = c = 1$).

Neomorphic and transformational characters [sensu @Sereno2007] were allocated to two separate partitions whose proportion of invariant characters and gamma shape parameters were allowed to vary independently (`unlink shape=(all) pinvar=(all);`).
Neomorphic characters were not assumed to have a symmetrical transition rate – that is, the probability of the absent → present transition was allowed to differ from that of the present → absent transition, being drawn from a uniform prior (`prset applyto=(`_number of Neomorphic partition_`) symdirihyperpr=fixed(1.0);`).

Two MrBayes runs were executed, each sampling eight chains for 400 000 generations, with samples taken every 250 generations.  Convergence was indicated by PSRF = 1.00 and an estimated sample size of > 100 for each parameter.  The first 10% of samples were discarded as burn-in, and a posterior tree topology was derived from the combined posterior sample of both runs.
