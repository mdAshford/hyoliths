**Table S1: Provenance of fossil material.** Individuals from the Yaoying section are usually bigger, with a thicker body wall, and have a smaller ratio of apertural width to shell length than specimens from other areas. 
In the absence of other differentiating features, we consider these deviations to represent ecophenotypical variation within a single species, perhaps reflecting the increased energetics and predation pressure that accompany the shallower water depth reported at the Yaoying section [@Zhao2012].
